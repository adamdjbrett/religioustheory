<p><strong>When</strong>: Sept. 26-27, 2025</p>



<p><strong>Where:</strong>&nbsp;Online</p>



<p><strong>Sponsored by the</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>in Collaboration with the University of Denver</strong></p>



<h3><a href="https://udenver.zoom.us/meeting/register/gUvFXvXGS_eJ1XP5MteMjA">Register Now</a></h3>



<p><strong><em>You must register in order to receive a participation link for conference.  Once you register, the actual link for the conference will be sent to your email address.</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Please note that the dates of the conference have been changed from the original CFP due to the very low participation of Western hemisphere scholars.  Because of time zone differences, the original schedule of noon on Sept. 25 to late afternoon Sept. 26 has been changed to early morning on Sept. 26 to noon on (Sat.), Sept. 27.  Program times are Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).</em></p>



<p>The<em>&nbsp;Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory</em>&nbsp;(<em>JCRT</em>) announces an online conference entitled&nbsp;<em>Populism, Nationalism, and the Future of Democracy</em>&nbsp;to be held Sept. 26-27, 2025.&nbsp;<em>The proceedings will be published and developed into a special issue of the JCRT in 2026.</em>&nbsp;Prizes of $300, $150, and $100 will be awarded for first, second, and third place in the competition among final submitted papers. Only papers that are submitted and selected for the conference will be eligible for the prize.</p>



<p>The conference seeks to explore the complex and evolving intersection between populism and nationalism and its rejection of the neoliberal global order. It aims to shine a particular spotlight on how religious ideologies and moral value systems, both conservative and progressive, motivate and shape contemporary populist movements as well as their nationalist forms of political expression. Finally, the conference looks to answer the more overarching question: what implications does the growing influence of populist and neo-nationalist constituencies have for the future of democracy?</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong>&nbsp;Online</p>



<p><strong>Submission deadline:</strong>&nbsp;Aug. 1, 2025</p>



<p><strong>Sponsored by the</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>in Collaboration with the University of Denver</strong></p>



<p>The<em> Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory</em> (<em>JCRT</em>) invites proposals for an online conference of <em>Populism, Nationalism, and the Future of Democracy</em> to be held Sept. 25-26, 2025. <em>The proceedings will be published and developed into a special issue of the JCRT in 2026.</em>  Prizes of $300, $150, and $100 will be awarded for first, second, and third place in the competition among final submitted papers.  Only papers that are submitted and selected for the conference will be eligible for the prize.</p>



<p>The conference seeks to explore the complex and evolving intersection between populism and nationalism and its rejection of the neoliberal global order.  It aims to shine a particular spotlight on how religious ideologies and moral value systems, both conservative and progressive, motivate and shape contemporary populist movements as well as their nationalist forms of political expression.  Finally, the conference looks to answer the more overarching question:  what implications does the growing influence of populist and neo-nationalist constituencies have for the future of democracy?</p>



<p>The conference organizers are seeking proposals of high academic quality that take a reflective and analytical approach in consideration of both general and specific topics that have an international appeal or focus.  We are<em> not</em> interested in papers that are <em>de facto</em> advocacy pieces, political screeds, or defamatory  harangues against certain nations, peoples, or groups.</p>



<p>As the<em>&nbsp;Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory</em>&nbsp;works toward a special issue on Populism, Nationalism, and the Future of Democracy, our goal is to create an interdisciplinary forum to examine these pressing issues. We encourage contributions from a spectrum of perspectives, approaches, and methodologies.</p>



<p><em>Themes and Topics</em></p>



<p>We encourage submissions that engage with, but are not limited to, the following areas of inquiry:</p>



<ul><li>religion, race, class, and secular ideology in the formation of populism cadres and national identity</li><li>the varieties of populism with reference to local cultures and national legacies</li><li>the tension and conflict between neoliberal concepts of global order and populist movements</li><li>competing political theories of democracy and their historical and intellectual sources</li><li>forms of &#8220;moral politics&#8221; (in George Lakoff&#8217;s phrasing), or the interaction of socio-ethical value frames and their political manifestations</li><li>globalization, the &#8220;postmodern&#8221; fracturing of social identity, and its impact on democratic governance</li><li>religious nationalisms and their significance, or lack thereof</li><li>the nuanced meaning of the term &#8220;authoritarianism&#8221;, including focused case studies</li><li>political and religious &#8220;mythmaking&#8221; in the genesis of populist and nationalist insurgencies</li></ul>



<p><em>Submission Guidelines</em></p>



<p><strong>Submission</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of Proposals:</strong>&nbsp;Contributors should send an abstract of 300-500 words outlining their proposal and its relevance to the theme of the conference/special issue. Panels and oral presentations as well as finished papers are welcome. Proposals should at the top provide the following information: Full Name, Professional Title, Institutional Affiliation, Email, Telephone number, Proposal Title.</p>

<p><em>Sponsored by the <a href="https://thewhitestonefoundation.org/">The Whitestone Foundation</a> dba </em><a href="http://jcrt.org">The Journal for Cultural and Religious</a><em><a href="http://jcrt.org"> Theory</a> in collaboration with the University of Denver.</em></p>



<p>The conference seeks to explore the complex and evolving intersection between religious beliefs, ethical principles, and bioethical concerns that have become prominent in contemporary social discourse.</p>



<p>The burgeoning field of bioethics, which seeks to navigate complex and often controversial issues in medical practice, biotechnology, and public health, finds itself in constant dialogue with questions of moral and ethical responsibility. Religion, as a fundamental aspect of human life and culture, contributes richly to this discourse, offering frameworks that shape individuals’ ethical orientations and responses to bioethical dilemmas.</p>



<p>Historically, religious traditions have deeply influenced moral philosophy and ethical decision-making. From the Hippocratic Oath to modern-day debates on genetic engineering, assisted reproduction, and end-of-life care, religious thought provides vital insights and moral considerations.</p>



<p>Various religions have taken stances on the inherent dignity of human life, the moral limits of medical intervention, and the sanctity of the human body. These stances continue to significantly impact legislation, medical practice, and public opinion on bioethical matters.</p>



<p>As the<em>&nbsp;Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory</em>&nbsp;works toward a special issue on Religion and Bioethics, we aim to create an interdisciplinary forum to examine these pressing issues. This special issue seeks to facilitate a richer understanding by bringing together scholarly contributions that investigate how religious beliefs and ethical principles interact within the realm of bioethics. We encourage contributions from a spectrum of perspectives, approaches, and methodologies.</p>

<p><em>The following article is published in three installments.</em></p>



<p><em>Introduction</em></p>



<p>Zeynep, a 37-year-old Turkish woman, comes from a secular family background. She has traveled to Bali and India on different occasions to participate in yoga and meditation courses. Her main goal for joining these activities was to heal her childhood traumas and release emotions related to unpleasant memories. During both courses, much to her surprise, the facilitators led the group in a chant of an ‘eastern mantra,’ the <em>zikr</em><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> of the phrase <em>La ilahe illallah</em>. Zeynep says, “We all stood up, held hands, and started singing <em>La ilahe illallah </em>accompanied by a guitar, while also turning around hand in hand!”. </p>



<p>She explains that in her friend and family circles, public expressions of Islam, such as reciting religious expressions in Arabic, did not exist and were not appreciated. Therefore, hearing the Arabic phrase during the activity stirred mixed feelings in her; on the one hand, she felt ‘at home,’ but on the other, she could not help thinking how ‘that thing’ found her there—in a yoga and meditation course. Zeynep continues to engage in Sufi readings and practice yoga and meditation, which she sees as instruments that heal her ‘inner child’ on the path to reaching her own truth and finding her ‘authentic’ self.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>



<p>What particularly
strikes my curiosity in Zeynep’s narrative is how a practice, previously
unimaginable for someone like her—a ‘secular,’ ‘modern,’ and ‘free’ woman, as
she describes herself—has become imaginable. What are the underlying conditions
through which the <em>zikr</em> or chanting <em>La ilahe illallah</em>, laden with
political implications, particularly in the Turkish context, becomes a sensible
practice in specific situations for a secular individual? What are the
processes by which certain religious and traditional practices get delinked
from their particular cultural contexts and find new meanings? Lastly, in what
ways are new connections and continuities drawn between past and present or old
and new, such as between Sufi rituals and therapeutic methods for trauma
processing?</p>



<p>To answer these questions, I will present an analysis of contemporary spiritual practices from the theoretical framework of “religion as mediation.” I argue that healing practices emerge as the primary practices of mediation through which individuals seek to transcend the ordinary and form links between a number of culturally meaningful dichotomies, such as external and internal, visible and invisible, conscious and unconscious, constructed and authentic/real. I suggest that the notion of healing acquires its specific meaning through an interplay between religion and psychology, whereby old practices get refashioned within a psychologizing framework and acquire a ‘therapeutic’ label. </p>



<p>Once religious practices are framed as therapeutic, they are rearticulated in scientific terms and <em>rationalized</em> based on their effects on the psychological and physiological functions of the human body. The therapeutic serves as a frame within which individuals reorganize diverse past forms and draw links between them. Hence, the meaning of healing in contemporary spiritual forms extends far beyond a mere elimination of a disease, recovery from sickness, or the transformation of self. It rather refers to a ‘world repairing’ process, occurring at both personal and collective levels, whereby participants of the contemporary spiritual milieu gather the fragments of past forms and recombine them in personalized bricolages through the mediation of the therapeutic. In this way, past and present, old and new, sacred and secular, mystical and rational are recomposed into one coherent, consistent, and continuous <em>whole</em> where the individual can <em>safely</em> dwell. </p>



<p>This study draws primarily on data gathered between 2018 and 2020 during a joint research project funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> The fieldwork spanned five different cities, and 72 interviews were conducted with individuals who either organized or participated in activities that fall outside of institutional or traditional forms of faith. As part of the research team, I took part in various events, workshops, circles, and retreats which involved different combinations of practices, such as yoga, meditation, shamanic and Sufi rituals, tai chi, qigong, homeopathy, storytelling, art therapy, astrology, breath therapy, energy healing, reiki, detox diets, ayurveda, mindfulness technics, regression therapy, feng shui, aromatherapy, family constellation, and numerology. </p>



<p>Some participants were primarily interested in affecting a change in their personal lives and some others, who saw themselves as ‘changemakers’, believed that change at the individual level would also work as a positive transformative force upon the larger community. The existing literature recognizes that the meaning of healing in contemporary spiritual forms is much more than a simple elimination of an illness or a disease. For instance, Meredith McGuire observed that for adherents of very different healing approaches, healing signified a particular type of ‘self-transformation’.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Beckford (1984) suggested that new religious and healing movements in North America and Europe cultivate and promote a distinctive relationship between ethics, spirituality, and healing.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> </p>



<p>The majority of relevant academic works focus on the therapeutic techniques adopted by diverse groups, the different conceptualizations of body, mind, and soul in healing systems, and the ways healing effects and experiences are produced. However, the existing literature has not sufficiently explored the questions of why and how healing has become such a central theme in religious/spiritual discourse.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> I believe the reason is because despite the recognition that the signification of the notion varies culturally, ‘to be healed’ is somehow assumed to be a major function and a <em>desired</em> state for <em>all</em> religious and spiritual cultures. In my analysis, I intend to problematize this assumption by providing a brief comparison as to the varying significations of healing in different spiritual and religious cultures existing in Turkey.&nbsp; In so doing, I aim to contextualize the central position of healing in contemporary spiritual forms and relate it to the rise of ‘therapy culture’ and the spread of the therapeutic language.</p>



<p>The paper is structured as follows: First, I review the media perspective in religious studies and explain how I use the therapeutic as a historically specific medium, a product of a scientific endeavor to articulate and manage human processes. Second, I present the meanings that the notion of healing has acquired in various spiritual and religious discourses in Turkey to avoid a generic understanding of the concept and to highlight the distinctive forms it has taken in contemporary spiritualities. Third, I discuss how the therapeutic as a medium interacts with religious mediums and <em>remediates</em> past forms, initiating connections between systems and processes that were previously considered to be discrete and incompatible. Finally, I examine how the initiated connections come to define healing as a ‘world repairing’ act, through which both the individual and the world are constructed as <em>wholes</em> made up of <em>connected</em> parts, rather than disconcerted fragments. </p>



<p><em>Culture, Mediation, and Therapeutic Media</em></p>



<p>The line of scholarship that views religion as mediation concentrates on the diverse ways whereby the ‘distance’ between the earthly and the divine or the visible and the invisible are mediated in different religious/spiritual traditions<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>. The focus, in this approach, is placed on the techniques and technologies referred to as ‘medium,’ through which communication with and about ‘the sacred’ becomes possible.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Here, a medium is not taken as a fixed genre or a simple vehicle of communication that embeds a particular content. Instead, a medium is seen as a cultural construction endowed with the power to serve a particular purpose, the value of which is also generated and embraced by groups or individuals in a given context.</p>



<p>Examples of a religious medium might involve both material and nonmaterial things, such as certain bodily practices, sensations, performances, words, books, images, prayers, prophecies, music, dance, spirit mediums, priests, healers, prophets, amulets, icons, oils, powders, incenses, liquids, shrines, temples, churches, mosques, audiocassettes, or videos <strong>(</strong><em>De Witte 2008: 19</em><strong>).</strong> In a similar vein, Quran is also a religious medium, and a variety of practices derived from it, such as reciting verses, producing Islamic calligraphy, or chanting the <em>zikr</em> of the phrase <em>La ilahe illallah</em>, are mediation practices through which the sacred word is channeled on earth in various aural and visual forms. Such practices are endowed with power in mediating the assumed ‘distance’ between the sacred and the profane.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> Therefore, performing them is considered to incite a process of transformation that will progressively render humans ‘closer’ to the sacred presence. </p>



<p>Mediation is intrinsic to culture; experience is constructed and put into the narrative through the recognized forms of mediation in a particular cultural context. In this paper, the way I use ‘therapeutic’ is also related to a historically specific cultural framework which is termed ‘therapy culture’ to refer to the distinctive influence of psychotherapeutic language in shaping our understanding of what is sensible, possible, communicable, and doable.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> My use of ‘therapeutic’ should not be confused with the term’s clinical connotations that inform the relationship between a patient and a therapist. Rather, by ‘therapeutic,’ I mean a range of practices and discursive tools that help mediate between a series of dichotomies, such as internal vs. external<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>, conscious and unconscious, visible vs. invisible, known vs. unknown, self vs. the other, representation vs. reality, rational vs. irrational, chaos vs. order, discord vs. harmony, and conflict vs. unity. </p>



<p>These tools, which I will refer to as ‘therapeutic media’<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> from now on, involve a variety of concepts, narrative templates, idioms, causal frameworks, vocabularies, explanatory schemas, methods, techniques, procedures, treatments, and modes of intervention through which human beings build their world and make sense of it. Therapeutic media reifies that world and the ‘therapy culture’ by acting as an institutionally authorized medium, that draws links between various oppositions and oversees a sensible exchange between them. Different from religious mediums, therapeutic media does not necessarily claim to mediate between the sacred and profane. On the contrary, its emergence was a result of a search for materialistic explanations for the ‘higher mental powers of humans,’ which were traditionally associated with the realm of the divine.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> </p>



<p>The history of therapeutic media goes back to the emergence of psychology as a modern scientific discipline in Europe and North America in the second half of the 19th century. Though a multiplicity of approaches within psychology and its cognates existed, the discipline evolved alongside and out of the secularization processes. It sought to find laws, procedures, and techniques with which the ‘hidden’ aspects of human thinking and behavior could be rendered not only visible and intelligible but also manageable.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> It, therefore, is taken as a ‘technology of self,’ that constructed the contemporary apparatus for ‘being human’.<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> Thus, therapeutic media does not only incorporate tools for ‘world-building’, but it also directs humans in terms of how to inhabit that world. </p>



<p><em>Changing Meaning of Healing</em></p>



<p>Most scholars recognize the central role of healing in contemporary spiritual practices. However, there has been insufficient exploration into the specific meanings this complex notion has acquired within contemporary spiritual forms. I believe that the elevated status of healing in contemporary societies often obscures its potential negative connotations or its peripheral position within various religious and spiritual cultures. The excerpt from Hervieu-Léger&#8217;s work, wherein she describes healing as one of the three primary themes of new spiritualities, aptly illustrates my point: </p>



<p>The first thematic focus, and undoubtedly the most central, is that of the representations and expectations relating to health and healing. It will rightly be pointed out that the centrality of the theme of healing in contemporary forms of faith does not present any<em> originality </em>[emphasis added]. Protection against disease concerns the mortality of humans, which is already a central object of all known forms of magic. The return to health constitutes, <em>in all human societies </em>[emphasis added]one of the main purposes of ritual mobilization and supernatural powers. No religion fails to address, though in varying forms, the fundamental human urge to escape suffering and illness (Translation from French is mine).<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>



<p>In the above passage, an unquestioned relationship is assumed between healing and spirituality, and healing is framed, in a way, as the ultimate function of religion/spirituality. I consider Régis Dericquebourg’s book, <em>Croire et Guérir</em> (<em>To</em> <em>Believe and to Heal</em>), particularly important in this respect, because he adopts a historical perspective and refrains from assigning a fixed position to healing in religious discourse. Dericquebourg’s main argument is that while healing was only peripherical within the matrix of other theological notions, it constitutes the central pillar of practices and doctrines for religions founded through the late 19<sup>th</sup> and the early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Moreover, although terms like ‘healing,’ ‘health,’ ‘illness,’ and ‘suffering’ have been fundamental in shaping human cultures, they do not carry fixed meanings or clear positive/negative connotations. Instead, they work as metaphors for understanding how a social reality is constructed in a specific context. </p>



<p>Consequently, I believe that examining the various meanings of healing, while giving due attention to the authorized forms of mediation within the broader cultural context, can offer a more nuanced understanding of the concept. Below, I present a brief outline of spiritism and the signification of healing within the spiritist culture, yet another non-institutionalized form, which emerged and rose in popularity in the 1940s, alongside the secularization policies promoted and imposed by the Turkish Republic. The comparative framework will help to contextualize the therapeutic turn in contemporary spiritualities by allowing to trace the (dis)continuities between these two forms. The particular meaning of healing in these two distinct non-institutional forms is informed by the different positions they have taken vis- à-vis science, in particular, psychology and religion.</p>



<p>My focus, therefore, will be primarily on two things; first, the selectivity at work in how spiritism and more contemporary spiritual forms appropriated certain psychological concepts, and second, their attitude towards Sufi traditions, which have heavily influenced both the institutionalized form of Islam and heterodox religious forms practiced throughout the country.  </p>

<p>The United States likes to present itself as a global leader, yet, when it comes to tackling what is arguably the greatest crisis facing humanity, global climate change, we have fallen woefully short of that idea. The nation’s failure to adequately address the climate crisis is in part the product of an American vision of the good life predicated on endless cycles of consumption that drives environmental destruction and contributes to a changing climate. </p>



<p>This vision, partnered with flat-out denial of environmental problems by some politicians, and the inability to cross ideological divides point to something profoundly amiss with America’s values and politics. Stalemate, not reason, rules the day. Given the warnings by the international scientific community as well as the Department of Defense, the inability, or refusal, of the United States government to seriously address global climate change is both a political and moral failure. How can this be fixed? Can it be fixed?</p>



<p>It can be repaired. The answer lies in the republican tradition of virtue. The United States was founded as a republic. Republicanism was the ideology of the Enlightenment.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The term ‘republic’ derives from the Latin&nbsp;<em>res publica</em>, which Knud Haakonssen explains was the “public realm of affairs that people had in common outside their familial lives” and has traditionally been known as the common weal, or commonwealth.</p>



<p> A republic also referred to the “institutional structures of public life” according to which the public would participate in the ways that government structures were organized.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;With an emphasis on the common good and citizen participation, a republic was considered the most just form of government. Achieving justice, the virtue of the state, required virtue from the citizens and their representatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The republican form of government has its roots in Greek philosophy, particularly within<em>&nbsp;</em>the thought of Plato and Aristotle. Central to their ideas of creating a just government was the concept of virtue, those qualities, traits and dispositions that contribute to the formation of an excellent character. According to Aristotle, virtue is a necessary condition for an individual to achieve a happy, flourishing life. Likewise, virtue is a necessary condition for a republic to achieve both justice and the common good.</p>



<p>Some philosophers have argued that virtues are an essential component of any environmental ethic, which Ronald Sandler defines as the norms of action or norms of character that govern our interaction with the environment and have begun the work of forming an environmental virtue ethic.[3]&nbsp;Environmental virtues are the appropriate dispositions, qualities, or character traits humans need to cultivate in order to have beneficial interactions and relationships with the environment and non-human animals.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Sandler observes, any meaningful changes to environmental policies and practices will require a transformation in human habits towards the environment. As such, a virtuous character is necessary for progressing right action and behavior.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>&nbsp;A complete environmental ethic must include virtue. Environmental virtue can provide the necessary wisdom in applying action-guiding rules and principles to particular situations. Environmental virtue may also aid in weighing conflicting moral demands or arbitrating between a plurality of value sources and justifications.&nbsp;<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>



<p>In her book&nbsp;<em>Dirty Virtues,<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn7"><sup><strong><sup>[7]</sup></strong></sup></a></em>&nbsp;Louke Van Wensveen reviewed environmental literature, including works by social ecologists, deep ecologists, animal rights activists, creation theologians, ecofeminists and environmental philosophers published after 1970 and identified 189 virtues and 174 vices.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtues Van Wensveen discovered were largely drawn from the traditional Aristotelian concept of virtues. However, she claims that ecological virtue language differs from this tradition in that some of the traditional vices and virtues are reinterpreted and reversed. </p>



<p>For example, mastery is a traditional virtue with positive connotations; in environmental literature mastery over nature is seen as a primary cause of environmental crises and as such is a vice.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The environmental virtue language unearthed by Van Wensveen is an emerging, diverse discourse in which different thinkers stress different virtues and vices. </p>



<p>Yet, it is a distinct moral vocabulary in which certain virtues like benevolence, care, compassion, frugality, gratitude and vices such as anthropocentrism, arrogance, greed and ignorance, constitute the moral landscape.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>&nbsp;She claimed that in her research she had yet to discover a work of “ecologically sensitive philosophy, theology, or ethics that does not in some way incorporate virtue language.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>&nbsp;Virtue, it would seem, is an inherent part of the language of environmental ethics.</p>



<p>Environmental virtue ethicists such as Geoffrey Frasz, Philip Cafaro and Ronald Sandler have largely focused on extending classical virtues such as benevolence, gratitude, compassion and moderation to environmental concerns. They have also examined the lives of persons who could be considered environmental exemplars and the virtues that they embodied. </p>



<p>Environmental virtue ethicists have also investigated the ways in which the natural world informs human character. What has largely been missing is the possibility of deriving environmental virtues from civic virtues. In her review of some of the primary publications in the field of environmental virtue ethics, Marilyn Holly observed environmental virtue theory lacks an accompanying political theory.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>John Barry commented the “language of civic republicanism has been largely absent from debates within green politics and theories of the politics and ethics of sustainability.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>&nbsp;Given that virtue is a necessary requirement for the success of a republic and that virtue is a primary component of environmental ethics, its absence in political and ethical debates is surprising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A possible explanation for this is that modern, liberal governments like that of the United States have focused on rights rather than virtue. This tends to emphasize the democratic process, liberty, and freedom rather than the character of the citizen. Rights are essential in protecting the interests of minority communities from what Alexis de Tocqueville called “the tyranny of the majority.” Yet, de Tocqueville also recognized the importance of traditional customs and virtues, what he called “the habits of the heart,” in tempering individualism and the tyranny of the majority. As such, rights are not free from virtue; rights are supported by virtue.</p>



<p>Brian Treanor notes much of the literature on environmental virtue ethics focuses on personal rather than public virtues. He suggests that the reason political virtues have largely been ignored is because it is easier to determine how an individual may act versus an entire citizenry. Furthermore, he notes there is a contemporary inclination to treat environmental virtues as private personal choices that may contribute to one’s personal happiness but are “neither essential for flourishing nor social in scope.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&nbsp;However, Treanor argues that public virtues, in particular political virtues that he identifies as a subset of public virtues, are the “keystone” for environmental virtue ethics. Without these political virtues, Treanor claims, “the whole edifice of environmental virtue is doomed to fall.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>



<p>A few environmental virtue ethicists have taken steps to rectify the lack of political virtue in environmental virtue ethics. By using Plato’s&nbsp;<em>Republic</em>&nbsp;as a model, Melissa Lane argues that we must recognize ourselves as citizens of eco-republics who take responsibility in creating a common good in which we all share.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Treanor also contributes by arguing the importance of recognizing that humans live in community, often in several overlapping communities at once, so the individual’s flourishing cannot be isolated from the communities in which they live. Treanor argues that “environmentalism must come to be thought of in terms that are explicitly and unavoidably political” because “in a commons, either we are all saved or none of us is saved.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>



<p>I believe we can develop a more comprehensive environmental virtue ethic that is informed by the civic virtues required of American citizens and which is also consistent with our religious past and spiritual present. In his 1984 book&nbsp;<em>After Virtue</em>. Alasdair MacIntyre argued that moral philosophy must begin in historical and social tradition. He wrote:</p>



<p>I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation, a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful expectations and obligations. These constitute the given of my life, my moral starting point. This is in part what gives my life its own moral particularity.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>



<p>Building on MacIntyre’s idea of grounding an ethic in history and social tradition, it can be demonstrated that there is an American tradition of virtue that can be utilized to inform a uniquely American environmental virtue ethic.&nbsp;&nbsp;By examining the primary writings of American politicians, religious leaders, and intellectuals a set of core American virtues can be identified. </p>



<p>After discovering these virtues within the American tradition, they can be compared with the virtues identified by Van Wensveen to see if they can also serve as environmental virtues, demonstrating that civic virtues can also be environmental virtues. My<em>&nbsp;</em>hope is that this will provide a path forward from the current political stalemate regarding environmental policy. Encouraging virtues in American citizens can both strengthen our government and lessen our impact on the natural world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps the best place to begin exploring the tradition of American virtue is with Benjamin Franklin, the epitome of the self-made man. Franklin believed the key to his success, and therefore success for anyone, could be found in the practice of virtue. He devoted an entire chapter of his autobiography to his pursuit of virtue and identified thirteen virtues to be practiced in the pursuit of moral perfection including temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>



<p>Although he clearly identified as a deist who rejected the idea of divine revelation, Franklin believed that “religious practices were beneficial because they encouraged good behavior and a moral society.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, that was the role many of the founders believed churches served the fledgling republic—instilling virtues into the citizenry. This is the reason Franklin supported a religious revival, the First Great Awakening, which swept through the colonies in the 1730s and 40s. The Great Awakening would help set the stage for American democracy. At its center was the evangelical preacher Jonathan Edwards who, like Franklin, would teach the necessity of virtue.</p>



<p>Although Edwards is more often than not associated with the hellfire and eternal damnation described in his sermon&nbsp;<em>Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</em>, that is not entirely representative of his thought. Edwards viewed the&nbsp;&nbsp;natural world as evidence of God’s eternal love and creativity. Since God’s creation was good, the natural world could be a source of virtue. In his&nbsp;<em>The Nature of True Virtue</em>, Edwards wrote that true virtue “consists in benevolence to Being in general…it is that consent, propensity and union of heart to Being in general, that is immediately exercised in a general good will.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>George Marsden explains that for Edwards, a loving God was at the center of creation who was constantly pouring forth His love to His creation so “the highest good is to return that love to God. If we truly love God, then we should also love what God loves, which is everything in creation, excepting evil or the negation of love.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>&nbsp;According to Edwards then, to live virtuously is to love God’s creation. We should love others, and the natural world, regardless of personal benefit or self-interest. Furthermore, in “Beauty of the World”, Edwards suggests that the beauty of the natural world mirrored the beauty of virtue:</p>



<p>The fields and woods seem to rejoice, and how joyful do the birds seem to be in it. How much a resemblance is there of every grace in the fields covered with plants and flowers, when the sun shines serenely and undisturbedly upon them. How a resemblance, I say, of every grace and beautiful disposition of mind; of an inferior towards a superior cause, preserver, benevolent benefactor, and a fountain of happiness…How great a resemblance of a holy and virtuous soul in a calm serene day.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>



<p>By emphasizing the goodness of creation and that true virtue lies in benevolence towards the natural world, Edwards’s theology can help inform an environmental virtue ethic that can appeal to American religious sentiments. Perhaps appealing to the founder of American evangelicalism and his theocentrism can help counter a strain of anti-environmentalism that runs through contemporary evangelical thought and&nbsp;help open a dialogue with the evangelical community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Jonathan Edwards died in 1758, did not live to see the American Revolution. There is no denying, however, that he was influential in the creation during subsequent decades of the American character and culture. The Revolution was considered a moral as well as a political revolution. </p>



<p>In the 1760s and 1770s, enormous attention was paid to the issue of virtue, which was seen as more political and historical than theological (Gaustad 1993, 54). However, the political and religious observance of virtue cannot be so easily separated. Perhaps due to their religious heritage, many colonists held the view that there was something uniquely virtuous about Americans. Some viewed the success of the revolution as evidence of divine favor. </p>



<p>Given the opportunity to create a government, there was little question that Americans would attempt to construct a republic.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the colonies had republican forms of government based on the republics of England.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>&nbsp;The question was whether Americans were truly virtuous enough to maintain a republic. As such, virtue was on nearly every American mind even before the daunting task of creating a national government presented itself to a fledgling nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The writers of the constitution drew upon over 2,000 years of political philosophy that taught that for a republic to succeed, citizens and elected officials had to be persons of virtue. Many colonists held the view that there was something uniquely virtuous about Americans, evidenced by the success of the revolution. Given the opportunity to create a government, there was little question that Americans would attempt to construct a republic. Indeed, the founders believed they were creating a republic of virtue led by virtuous men chosen by virtuous people to represent them.</p>



<p>Most Americans know the apocryphal story of a six-year-old Washington telling his father that he could not tell a lie after admitting to using a hatchet that he received as a gift to hack at a cherry tree. It is a didactic tale used to demonstrate Washington’s honesty, and also that virtue was an innate characteristic of the president. The tale is pure fiction though, invented by one of Washington’s earliest biographers who wanted to portray Washington as a moral exemplar for Americans</p>



<p>Although the story of the cherry tree is an American myth, Washington’s virtues are apparently based in reality. Gordon Woods writes that “Washington’s genius, Washington’s greatness, lay in his character” and that it was his “moral character that set him off from other men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington was praised as being the “living embodiment of all the classical republican virtues the age was eagerly striving to recover” which included “restraint, temperance, fortitude, dignity, and independence.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These were also arguably on display when Washington declined a third term as president, thus initiating one of the most important of American traditions &#8211; the peaceful transfer of power between elected leaders. His surrender of power and the integrity of his character would lead to comparisons with Cincinnatus, a classical Roman politician who was known for his virtue.</p>



<p>Thomas Jefferson, elected president in 1800, idealized America as a pastoral republic with a virtually endless frontier where democracy was intimately connected to the land and the virtues of its agrarian citizens. Nature, virtue, and equality were all connected in Jefferson’s thought. He envisioned a pastoral America where independent farmers would tame wild nature by transforming it into cultivated farmland whereby, they would be instilled with the virtues necessary for the citizenry of a democratic republic. </p>



<p>In his&nbsp;<em>Notes on the State of Virginia&nbsp;</em>he wrote that “those who labour in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever he had a chosen people, whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>&nbsp;Farming inculcates the virtues of independence and industry, along with “patience, resourcefulness, tranquility of mind, love of order, moderation in material expectations, as well as physical and spiritual well-being” which are all fortified by sustained contact with nature.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>



<p>While the president is to serve as a moral exemplar,&nbsp;&nbsp;the moral failings of the founding fathers, especially Jefferson ought to be acknowledged The American dream of opportunity and self-sufficiency was largely made possible through slavery, stolen land and genocide. Jefferson consistently railed against the institution of slavery, although he owned slaves himself and impregnated one six times. </p>



<p>He feared what the institution of slavery entailed for the nation’s future “I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep for ever.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>He believed that attitudes towards slavery were changing and hoped that eventually slaves would be emancipated by a change of consciousness rather than by force. Jefferson preferred harmony, not war, with the indigenous population; however, he prized their lands over peace. Despite the moral failings of the founders, I think it is important not to throw the virtuous baby out with the viscous bathwater. Virtue is not about perfection, but moral progress. The republic we were given is a more perfect union, not a perfect one, and we can still learn valuable moral lessons from flawed individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, changes to the nation’s land were so profound that American diplomat George Perkins Marsh warned that the unbridled exploitation of natural resources was having a devastating and permanent impact on the land. Fortunately, there were intimations of a fledgling environmental ethic, including, in addition to Marsh, the American Transcendentalist movement centered on Ralph Waldo Emerson that stressed a relationship to nature. Emerson’s concern for nature was developed in the context of mystical insights grounded in the natural world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney Ahlstrom described Emerson as a “new kind of romantic pagan” who abandoned his religious heritage and traditions for a “pantheistic view of man, nature and God.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature, God and mind were one for Emerson as well as the source of virtue.</p>



<p>Fellow Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, who was mentored by Emerson, remained grounded to the earth while hoeing beans during his two-year stay at Walden Pond. Thoreau observed nature with the eye of a scientist while writing as a prophet of the wild, pointing out the nation’s moral failures and criticizing the turn towards industrialization. According to Philip Cafaro, Thoreau’s sojourn at Walden Pond was an experiment to “become a better person defining this broadly to include increased knowledge, an enriched experience, character development, creative achievement, and greater personal integrity” making&nbsp;<em>Walden</em>&nbsp;a work of virtue ethics.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>



<p>Cafaro identified over one hundred virtues lauded by Thoreau in&nbsp;<em>Walden</em>&nbsp;including bravery, civility, compassion, contentment, economy, gratitude, humility, independence, industry, justice, prudence, purity, self-knowledge, self-reliance, simplicity and wakefulness.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>&nbsp;Although most think of Thoreau as separating himself from society to live on the shore of Walden Pond, he did not shy away from the political, having authored the influential essay&nbsp;<em>Civil Disobedience</em>&nbsp;which called on Americans to be persons of good character and conscience before being good citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few decades after the publication of&nbsp;<em>Walden</em>, John Muir would write of the glory of the American wilderness. In terms of his spirituality, Muir has been identified as “a pantheist, a Transcendentalist, a mystic, an ecocentric evolutionist, an idiosyncratic Protestant Christian, or a post-Christian Romantic.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>While each representation has its merit, perhaps it is best to say that for Muir nature was his religion. For Muir, the canyons, mountains, and valleys of the American wilderness were sacred spaces where one could develop environmental virtues including reverence, awe, wonder, humility, respect and an ecological consciousness. Although these virtues are grounded in his religious experiences, Muir’s attempts to preserve the wilderness required the classical republican virtue of political participation and as such, Muir is a role model for environmental advocacy, perseverance, and preservation. </p>



<p>But like the founders, his treatment of the indigenous populations who were on the land he wished to preserve was morally problematic, so nuance is required. Together, Emerson Thoreau, and Muir can provide an environmental virtue ethic that also informs civic virtues for Americans who may be spiritual, but less religiously inclined and particularly for those who find their spirituality rooted in nature.</p>



<p>If there was anyone who shaped American attitudes towards preservation and conservation more than Muir and Gifford Pinchot who served as the first head of the US Forest Service, it would be Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was a naturalist and prolific writer who connected the health of the republic with the health of its environment. He was hard pressed to put pen to paper without invoking virtue. Roosevelt insisted that character, which he defined as the “assemblage of virtues, active and passive, of moral qualities,” was the true measure of nation and citizen.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The virtues that lead to national greatness included “sobriety, steadfastness, the sense of obligation toward one’s neighbor and one’s God, hard common-sense, and, combined with it, the gift of generous enthusiasm toward whatever is right.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>&nbsp;In a 1910 speech titled “Citizenship in a Republic” Roosevelt identified “self-restraint, self-mastery, common sense, the power of accepting individual responsibility and yet of acting in conjunction with others, courage and resolution” as necessary republican virtues.<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other virtues extolled by Roosevelt include efficiency, honesty, altruism, justice, moderation, respect, self-reliance, patriotism, hope, frugality, strength, and courage, all of which appear on Van Wensveen’s list of environmental virtues. Roosevelt also demonstrated the environmental virtues of long-range thinking, prudence, ecological sensibility, clarity of vision, endurance, stewardship and collective action</p>



<p>Roosevelt is also responsible for beginning a Progressive Movement that sought reform in American politics. Contemporary with this was the Social Gospel, which was evangelicalism “awakened to the possibilities of a social salvation.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;There had long been a social aspect to evangelicalism in the United States, especially in the form of the Great Awakenings that always had “social, political, and economic overtones and results.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>&nbsp;However, this connection was made more explicit with the Social Gospel which had as its aim the remaking of society by gaining control of social forces and breaking the bonds of evil. The chief concern of the Social Gospel was the virtue of justice so the common good was emphasized in conjunction with the salvation of souls. With their deep concern of battling poverty, the ideas of Social Gospel can be especially pertinent to addressing environmental and social justice.</p>



<p>Virtues got Americans through the Great Depression and World War II. In his inaugural address, Franklin Delano Roosevelt&nbsp;explicitly called on the&nbsp;“old and precious moral values”&nbsp;to guide the recovery from the Depression. He invoked the virtues of honesty, boldness, hope, optimism, gratitude, courage, discipline and wisdom. “This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly,” he told Americans. Although he claimed, “only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment,” he assured Americans that the nation “will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.” Because “nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it,” he reminded Americans they “have still much to be thankful for.” No problem, he said, is unsolvable if faced “wisely and courageously.”<a href="applewebdata://78389CA2-33BA-4503-B079-48EF24AC752D#_ftn38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>



<p>In his fireside chats FDR invoked the virtues of honesty, boldness, hope, optimism, gratitude, courage, discipline, wisdom, patience, and cooperation. Likewise, during World War II it was believed that virtue at home would win the war abroad. Americans were urged to come together, to set aside individualism for the common good and embrace the virtues of determination, sacrifice, self-denial, industriousness, courage, endurance, loyalty,&nbsp;&nbsp;and cooperation. All of the virtues of the Great Depression and the Second World War can also serve as environmental virtues.</p>



<p>Much more can be said. My focus in this brief survey has been on prominent individuals, which has unfortunately excluded the voices of women and persons of color, though for a fuller exploration of a tradition of virtue in the United States, it is essential they not be ignored. No accounting of the moral tradition of the United States would be complete without including persons such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., George Washington Carver, sojourner truth, Jane Addams, and Rachel Carson. </p>



<p>Recognizing the limitations inherent in a shorter work, the purpose of this essay was to demonstrate a tradition of virtue in the United States that is informed by politics, religion, and nature. Although it is easy to think that Americans have abandoned the republican virtues for the vices of consumerism, the importance of civic virtues have never been entirely lost on the majority of Americans. The language of virtue can cut across political divides and encourage interreligious dialogue. It is an integral ethic that connects individual, community, and environment. The American tradition of virtue can guide political and community engagement as well as environmental activism. I believe it is by reviving and greening the American tradition of virtue that has run through the course of American history, that we can best meet the political, social and environmental challenges of the twenty-first century and beyond.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p><strong>When</strong>: Jan. 9-10, 2025</p>



<p><strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>



<p><strong>Submission deadline:</strong>  Nov. 20, 2024</p>



<p><strong>Sponsored by the</strong><em><strong> Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory </strong></em><strong>in Collaboration with the University of Denver</strong></p>



<p>The<em> Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory</em> (<em>JCRT</em>) invites proposals for an online conference of <em>Religion and Bioethics</em> to be held Jan. 9-10, 2025.   <em>The proceedings will be published and developed into a special issue of the JCRT in late 2025.</em></p>



<p>The conference seeks to explore the complex and evolving intersection between religious beliefs, ethical principles, and bioethical concerns that have grown prominent in contemporary social discourse.  </p>



<p>The burgeoning field of bioethics, which seeks to navigate
complex and often controversial issues in medical practice, biotechnology, and
public health, finds itself in constant dialogue with questions of moral and
ethical responsibility. Religion, as a fundamental aspect of human life and
culture, contributes richly to this discourse, offering frameworks that shape
individuals&#8217; ethical orientations and responses to bioethical dilemmas.</p>



<p>Historically, religious traditions have deeply influenced moral philosophy and ethical decision-making. From the Hippocratic Oath to modern-day debates on genetic engineering, assisted reproduction, and end-of-life care, religious thought provides vital insights and moral considerations. </p>



<p>Various religions have taken stances on the inherent dignity of human life, the moral limits of medical intervention, and the sanctity of the human body. These stances continue to significantly impact legislation, medical practice, and public opinion on bioethical matters.</p>



<p>As the<em> Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory</em> works toward a special issue on Religion and Bioethics, we aim to create an interdisciplinary forum to examine these pressing issues. This special issue seeks to facilitate a richer understanding by bringing together scholarly contributions that investigate how religious beliefs and ethical principles interact within the realm of bioethics. We encourage contributions from a spectrum of perspectives, approaches, and methodologies. </p>



<p><em>Themes and Topics</em></p>



<p>We encourage submissions that address, but are not limited to, the following issues:</p>



<ul><li>Genetic Engineering and CRISPR Technology:
Ethical implications of genome editing from various religious perspectives.
Considerations include the manipulation of human embryos, potential
consequences of genetic &#8220;enhancement,&#8221; and the moral duties toward
future generations.</li></ul>



<ul><li>End-of-Life Decisions: Religious and ethical
analysis of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Discussions may involve
doctrinal stances, cultural practices, and the protection of vulnerable
populations.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Reproductive Rights and Technologies: The moral and religious dimensions of assisted reproductive technologies, such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and surrogacy. Topics can include the status of embryos, parental responsibility, and the implications on family structures.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Healthcare Inequality: Examination of religious
teachings on justice and equity in the distribution of healthcare resources.
Analyses of how religious groups respond to disparities in healthcare access
and outcomes.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Pandemic Ethics: The intersection of religious
doctrine and policy-making during global health crises, such as COVID-19.
Ethical issues involving vaccine distribution, quarantine measures, and the
impact on religious communities.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Transgender Health: Ethical and religious
perspectives on transgender medical interventions, including hormone treatment
and gender-affirming surgeries. Considerations of bodily autonomy, identity
integrity, and religious freedom.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Neuroethics: Religious insights into
brain-computer interfaces, cognitive enhancement, and the implications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. Discussions on the nature of human
identity, consciousness, and moral agency.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Human Enhancement Technologies**: Theological
and ethical perspectives on cybernetics, including prosthetic enhancements,
bionics, and brain-machine interfaces. Examination of notions like the human
body&#8217;s sanctity and integrated wholeness from various religious traditions.</li></ul>



<p><em>Submission Guidelines</em></p>

<p>Such examples inspire a soul to be grateful and care for conserving this precious nature in all forms. It instills a feeling of solicitude for the planet. Capitalizing on spiritual guidance can thus protect nature&#8217;s bounty, benefiting all living beings who share this earth with humans. </p>

<p>The final passage of the morning Sikh prayer <em>Japji</em> <em>Sahib, </em>which regards air as a guru, water as the father, and the earth as the mother, relays the message that nature sustains life on this planet and that we must treat <em>her</em> with the utmost respect<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. However, the passage merits a thorough interpretation to gauge its significance. Air is the medium through which sound flows and makes the chanting of the <em>mantra </em>accessible to the mind. </p>



<p>The consciousness immersed in the Guru’s mantra leads to gnosis (<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%AC%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%81">ਸਬਦੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%97%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%82">ਗੁਰੂ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BF">ਸੁਰਤਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A7%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BF">ਧੁਨਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9A%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%B2%E0%A8%BE">ਚੇਲਾ </a>॥) (SGGS, M.1, <em>Raamkali Goshti</em>, 943). Breath, the vehicle for the mantra, has no existence without air. Therefore, air must be treated as sacred. Such reevaluation can motivate followers to consider reducing their carbon footprint. </p>



<p>The appellation
Mother Earth is universal. It has been frequently used in SGGS. For example,
“The womb of Mother Earth births everything”<a href="#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%89%E0%A8%A6%E0%A8%B0">ਉਦਰ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%97%E0%A9%80">ਸੰਜੋਗੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A7%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%80">ਧਰਤੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BE">ਮਾਤਾ </a>॥ (SGGS, M.1, <em>Maaru, </em>1021). Chahal has also explored
ecofeminist strands in the scripture along these lines.<sup> <a href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></sup> <a href="#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
Similarly, water deserves the status of a father as it is another vital life

day and night bear the connotation of solar energy (There can be no life

<p>Singh highlights the kinship among all beings through the following verse of Guru Ram Das:<sup> <a href="#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></sup> &nbsp;“There is only one breath (air), all are made of the same clay, and the light within is the same” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%8F%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%8B">ਏਕੋ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%A3%E0%A9%81">ਪਵਣੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%9F%E0%A9%80">ਮਾਟੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%AD">ਸਭ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%8F%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BE">ਏਕਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%AD">ਸਭ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%8F%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BE">ਏਕਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BF">ਜੋਤਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%AC%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%88%E0%A8%86">ਸਬਾਈਆ </a>॥(SGGS, M.4, <em>Maajh</em>, 96). An essay&#8217;s alternative expression of this interconnectedness reads, “We are the rock and the stars, the leaves, and the trees…we are the eyes through which the universe looks at itself. We are the minds through which the universe contemplates itself.”<a href="#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> </p>



<p>Hence, we must heal the planet by healing ourselves. This discussion of cosmic unity entails the reciprocal relationship between different entities of existence, and many other verses in SGGS articulate this interrelationship. SGGS declares, “What pervades the cosmos dwells in the body; whoever seeks finds it.” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%8B">ਜੋ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AC%E0%A9%8D%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%A1%E0%A9%87">ਬ੍ਰਹਮੰਡੇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%88">ਸੋਈ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BF%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%A1%E0%A9%87">ਪਿੰਡੇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%8B">ਜੋ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%96%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%88">ਖੋਜੈ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%8B">ਸੋ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B5%E0%A9%88">ਪਾਵੈ </a>॥ (SGGS, Peepaa, <em>Dhanaasari</em>, 695). Such verses unite panentheism, ecocentrism, and deep ecology themes. Virk remarks that the revelation that we all are born of the same matrix breaks the sense of hierarchical order of existence. It instills feelings of justice and compassion.<a href="#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The crux of the argument is that tampering with these elements will bring harm to us eventually because we live in an interconnected web of life.&nbsp; </p>



<p><em>Sustainable Living</em></p>



<p>Capitalism and neoliberalism are held responsible for the current environmental crisis. This is why activists believe that eco-justice should be viewed within the broader context of social justice and human development. The present situation has presented the challenge of ensuring continuing development at this rate without compromising the needs of future generations. Sahota<a href="#_ftn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> et al. reckon that sustainability requires a shift from anthropocentrism, which implies acknowledging the reciprocity of human beings’ relationship with nature. </p>



<p>Drawing a parallel between Sikh gurus’ teachings and Saint Francis’ philosophy, the authors offer a unity-in-diversity approach to developing a sustainable management model. This model assumes embracing diversity in all its complexity and developing a practical kinship through shared interests. Such a model accounts for equality and justice and leads to the value of selfless service in Sikhi.<a href="#_ftn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>



<p>Sikhi believes in balancing <em>Seva</em> (service) and <em>Simran</em> (contemplating the name of God). The phrase <em>Sarbat da Bhalaa </em>(welfare of all) from <em>ardaas</em> (the Sikh petitionary prayer) is unequivocally invoked in the context of socioeconomic justice. However, this ideal must be viewed as intertwined with environmental concerns to extend the act of service to planetary well-being.<a href="#_ftn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> </p>



<p>The guidance for this reevaluation should be sought in the historical examples where Gurus and their Sikhs protected adversaries, and their altruism included nonhumans. A story has already been discussed in this review before. This is directly related to Hukam<em>, </em>which is not seen separately from <em>Naam </em>(the name of God, also the energy of creation). In this regard, the Sikh ideal of communal wellbeing –Sarbat da Bhalaa— is comparable to the African <em>ubuntu</em> philosophy or the Latin American <em>buein vivir</em>.</p>



<p>The three pillars of Sikhi are <em>Naam Japnaa</em> (Contemplating the name of God), <em>Kirt Karnaa</em> (living by the sweat of brow), and <em>Vand Chhaknaa</em> (sharing resources). Sikhi does not approve of asceticism or renunciation.<a href="#_ftn12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> This one verse by Guru Nanak says it all: “One who eats by earning one’s livelihood by the sweat of their brow and shares one’s fortune with others, finds the path [of righteousness], says Nanak” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%98%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B2%E0%A8%BF">ਘਾਲਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%96%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%87">ਖਾਇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%9B%E0%A9%81">ਕਿਛੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%A5%E0%A8%B9%E0%A9%81">ਹਥਹੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%87">ਦੇਇ </a>॥ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%95">ਨਾਨਕ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B9%E0%A9%81">ਰਾਹੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%9B%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A3%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਪਛਾਣਹਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%87">ਸੇਇ </a>॥(SGGS, M.1, 1245). </p>



<p>Therefore, some have also stressed the belief in earning an honest living by hard work. Singh draws attention to the fact that a Sikh must actively engage with the world’s affairs by highlighting the blend of <em>Miri </em>(the temporal) and <em>Piri</em> (the spiritual) advocated and practiced by the Sikh gurus.<a href="#_ftn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> &nbsp;This is the driving force for all activism, which can be harnessed to adopt a holistic approach to solving environmental issues.</p>



<p>However,
the interconnectedness of the three ideals needs to be appreciated more. For
instance, those willing to ascend the levels of Naam must do seva. Furthermore,
if haumai (ego) persists, sevacannot
be called selfless.&nbsp; This implies that
one’s spiritual journey is incomplete without actively involving worldly
concerns and extending unqualified compassion to all creation. The faith
leaders and activists can draw on this understanding to encourage environmental
sensitivity and action among the devotees.</p>



<p>Many activists emphasize the role of frugality in saving the environment. It is also a pre-condition for inner happiness and one of the founding principles of eco-philosophy.<a href="#_ftn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> This is because choices made in one place have an impact and repercussions for the rest of the world when all are interdependent and interconnected.<a href="#_ftn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> A frugal lifestyle and sharing of resources promise sustainable living. Saryal and Saryal<a href="#_ftn16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> note that water was meant to be a shared resource in the gurdwaras, with large pools built by Sikh gurus. </p>



<p>The Gurus also built towns and cities around gurdwaras, serving as models of social justice and communal living. The fifth Sikh master, Guru Arjan Dev, initiated the practice of dasvandh (the one-tenth share of one’s earnings/resources), which many devout Sikhs follow. The Sikhs do not confine it to the financial resources only. Each Sikh decides, without the mediation of the priests, what and where they want to contribute. Imagine a world where everyone contributed their dasvandh to help the underprivileged! </p>



<p>Moreover,
the value of contentment is also critical to realizing these ideals. A lot has
been said about this value in SGGS, which can be used as an impetus for
sustainability discourses. Suffice it is to quote one line here: “A content
mind with compassion for all beings” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BF">ਮਨਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%96%E0%A9%81">ਸੰਤੋਖੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%AC">ਸਰਬ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%85">ਜੀਅ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%86">ਦਇਆ </a>॥ (SGGS, M.5, <em>Gaudi</em>, 299). Compassion is the reason
devout Sikhs adhere to a vegetarian diet. Cruelty to animals is strictly
condemned in Sikhi. A categorical directive in this can be read in this quote:
“Kabeer states that those mortals who consume marijuana, fish, and wine &#8211; no
matter what pilgrimages, fasts, and rituals they follow, will all go to hell” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%AC%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%B0">ਕਬੀਰ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AD%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%82%E0%A8%97">ਭਾਂਗ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%9B%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%B2%E0%A9%80">ਮਾਛੁਲੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BE">ਸੁਰਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BF">ਪਾਨਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%8B">ਜੋ ਜੋ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A9%8D%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A8%E0%A9%80">ਪ੍ਰਾਨੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%96%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%82%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਖਾਂਹਿ </a>॥ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%A5">ਤੀਰਥ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AC%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%A4">ਬਰਤ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%AE">ਨੇਮ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%8F">ਕੀਏ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%87">ਤੇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%AD%E0%A9%88">ਸਭੈ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%B2%E0%A8%BF">ਰਸਾਤਲਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%82%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਜਾਂਹਿ </a>॥ (SGGS, Bhagat Kabeer, 1377). </p>



<p>Recognizing the inalienable rights of all living beings is crucial to achieving sustainability targets and building a harmonious world society. The foundation of the sovereign commonwealth of <em>Khalsa</em> by the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, in 1699 was a momentous step in this direction. Guru Gobind Singh included people from different castes, regions, and occupations in this new socio-political fold. </p>



<p>The Khalsa was ordained to follow Sikh spiritual discipline and stand up for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised. It was thus a radical model of political autonomy and solidarity, wherein all members lived as saint soldiers. Singh<a href="#_ftn17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> writes that the Khalsa army fought the tyrant Mughal rulers in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries and against the atrocities of the British colonists and Indian government subsequently. The ideal was to strive for justice for all.</p>



<p>The Sikh
gurus condemned casteism and class distinctions and upheld the intrinsic worth
of all beings. The tenth master, Guru Gobind Singh, asked his Sikhs to
recognize all human races as the same. The Sikh scripture contains verses from
saints affiliated with different spiritual traditions (with a unified
philosophy) who were treated as outcastes, like Naamdev, Kabeer, and Ravidas.
Guru Nanak started the tradition of <em>langar,
</em>serving food to the needy and the visitors, where all classes and castes
sat together. It was a revolutionary step toward creating an egalitarian
society in those times as caste divisions were rigidly followed. Saryal and
Saryal<a href="#_ftn18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
describe this as a spiritual and political practice because it historically
allowed the Sikhs to practice food sovereignty. Gurdwaras thus supported local
farmers. </p>



<p>Sikh Gurus also accorded high respect to women. Celebrating femininity, all Sikh Gurus depicted human souls, regardless of gender, as brides/females longing for the Beloved Lord in their verses. Guru Nanak reminded us that all great men were born of women. The Sikh historical narratives honor the contribution of women as saints and warriors. The Sikh history offers many examples of what Arturo Escobar calls “politics in the feminine.”<a href="#_ftn19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> </p>



<p>The Khalsa honors Sahib Kaur, the wife of Guru Gobind Singh, as their mother. She played a crucial role in inspiring the Khalsa to blend valor with compassion. She embodied this ideal by adding sugar to the holy water churned by a sword during the first initiation ceremony of the Khalsa. The tradition continues to this day. Therefore, the principles of bio-civilization—diversity, autonomy, solidarity, collective action, simplicity, justice, equity, etc.—as outlined by Kothari are enshrined in Sikh history and scripture.<a href="#_ftn20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>



<p><em>Historical and
Modern Praxis</em></p>



<p>This
section examines how Sikh Gurus embodied the themes of kinship, community,
biocentric equality, or reverence for nature and how these memories were
historically constructed. It gives examples of reconstructing those memories
and traditions in alignment with the ecological themes. These examples include
initiatives by the spiritual leaders and organizations in the community.
Further, it critiques why and where there are disjuncts when living the ideals
laid down by the Gurus and endorsed by the spiritual leaders. </p>



<p>Sikh spiritual leaders have judiciously
reconstructed the story of trees in various environmental campaigns. Guru Arjan
Dev, the fifth Master, describes the Creator as a grand tree and the creation
as its branches (SGGS, M.5, <em>Maajh</em>,
102; M.5, <em>Aasaa</em>, 387). Guru Har Rai,
the seventh Master, planted many trees and plants. There are 58 historic Sikh
shrines named after 19 species of trees. Each has a <em>saakhi</em> (historical account or anecdote from the life of Gurus)
centering on the tree it is named after.<a href="#_ftn21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>&nbsp; One quote from SGGS sums up the status of
trees in Sikhi: “ [If ] aspiring to be a dervish, bear the patient endurance
like a tree” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%B5%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%82">ਦਰਵੇਸਾਂ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8%E0%A9%8B">ਨੋ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B2%E0%A9%8B%E0%A9%9C%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%90">ਲੋੜੀਐ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%96%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%82">ਰੁਖਾਂ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%80">ਦੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%82%E0%A8%A6%E0%A8%BF">ਜੀਰਾਂਦਿ </a>॥ (SGGS, Fareed, 1381). </p>



<p>Guru Har Rai is often cited for his eco-sensitivity. One of the stories recounts his remorse at breaking a flower from brushing his cloak against it. The young Har Rai expressed remorse for the inadvertent harm to the plant and carefully gathered his clothing around him for the rest of his life. His native place, Keeratpur Sahib, was a town of parks and gardens and was an idyllic place in his lifetime, which attracted many birds and animals to it. Here, he also built a large garden with medicinal plants. It was called <em>Naulakhaa Baagh</em>, meaning a garden with 900,000 trees. </p>



<p>Many agencies have collaborated to research those ancient plants and revive the garden and the indigenous medicine.<a href="#_ftn22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> The Sikh Environment Day, March 14, is dedicated to Guru Har Rai, who ascended to the position of Guru on this day.<a href="#_ftn23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Similarly, the Tri-cultural Sikh Society, a gurdwara near Pittsburgh, named their arboretum after Guru Har Rai in 2013. The arboretum features plant species native to Pennsylvania.<a href="#_ftn24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>



<p>Sant Seva Singh from <em>Khadoor Sahib</em>, a historic town in Punjab graced by the visit of eight Sikh Gurus, is a much-respected religious figure in the region. Known as The Tree Man, he was appointed the Faith for Earth counselor by the United Nations Environment Programme in 2021. He presented the Sikh Plan on Environment to Ban-ki-Moon at Windsor Castle in 2009. On the 550<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Guru Nanak’s avatar in 2019, he set up a goal of planting 550 small dense forests, called Guru Nanak Memorial Forests, with 50 different varieties of trees. </p>



<p>He has planted 272 so far. He has planted 6.5 million trees all over India.<a href="#_ftn25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Comparing his environmental venture to <em>langar</em> (the Sikh tradition of serving food to the needy), he believes these initiatives serve the environmentally sick generation.<a href="#_ftn26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> He distributes saplings among devotees as a <em>Prashad (a gift of grace usually offered as </em>food). He has worked tirelessly to reclaim the green zone in Punjab. He has revived many native species of plants and persuaded farmers to prefer orchard farming to less sustainable crops.<a href="#_ftn27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> He runs a charitable organization, Nishan-e-Sikhi, which works for education and social welfare besides environmental causes. </p>



<p>Another excellent example of
reconstruction is the Museum of Trees in the capital of Punjab, Chandigarh,
which was established in 2020. It was conceived and curated by DS Jaspal on his
personal property and promoted by the Chandigarh Nature and Health Society.
Inspired by his book ‘Tryst with Trees-Punjab’s Sacred Heritage,’ this
storytelling museum recounts customs, traditions, and historical events
associated with every tree planted here. As a former high-ranking civil servant
with a background in forestry, Jaspal employs both scientific and marketing
techniques to conserve genetic clones of 12 sacred trees associated with
historical Sikh shrines. Besides, it has a section devoted to medicinal plants.
Environmental education for school children and the community is part of this
conservation project, particularly on endangered species.<a href="#_ftn28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>



<p>A similar eco-aesthetic endeavor can be found at a place sanctified by the visit of four Sikh Gurus— historical <em>gurdwara</em> (Sikh place of worship), Guru-Sar Sahib, in Patto Hira Singh village in the Moga district of Punjab. It is a botanical garden (<em>baagh</em>) featuring more than 58 species of trees mentioned in SGGS. EcoSikh, a US-based Sikh environmental organization in collaboration with a local non-profit, PETALS, inaugurated it in 2021. Named Guru Granth Sahib Baagh, it has about 6,000 trees and shrubs spread over 5 acres of land. </p>



<p>Each tree carries relative references from the scripture calligraphically inscribed on big round stones. This environmental initiative aims to highlight the message of the Sikh Gurus to connect with nature. Dedicated to the 550<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Guru Nanak’s avatar, it aims to offer a platform for environmental education.<a href="#_ftn29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>



<p>Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal is another saintly figure in the Sikh community who has lived the ideals of Sikh ecosophy. He was named one of Time magazine’s ‘Heroes of the Environment’ 2008 for his monumental river-cleaning project in 2000. He spearheaded the community enterprise of cleaning the 170-kilometer-long river <em>Kali Bein</em>, a tributary of the longer river <em>Beas </em>in Punjab. He took the initiative by entering the river and manually removing the water hyacinth. </p>



<p>This river holds a deep significance in Sikh history because Guru Nanak took a dip here, disappeared for three days, and reappeared after being enlightened. The river, however, had become polluted over time with an overgrowth of water hyacinth, industrial effluents, and agricultural run-off. Its successful cleaning by the local community, without any help from the government, is an excellent example of ecosystem conservation. The project has now been extended to other rivers in Punjab.<a href="#_ftn30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> So, Sant Seechewal, known as the Eco-baba, exemplified Gurbani&#8217;s ideals to restore rivers. He addressed the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 and spoke of how Sikhi is an ecological religion that teaches holding natural elements in deep reverence.</p>



<p>No Sikh environmentalism discourse is complete without reckoning the far-sighted activism of Bhagat Puran Singh ji, the bearded Mother Teresa of Punjab. Bhagat ji, who practiced the discipline of Naam, believed in transforming the face of the earth through work on both mind and matter. The prefix Bhagat (an imbued devotee) was assigned to him because of his exalted spiritual state. He was the epitome of the Sikh ideals who carried the legacy of eco-philosophy forward. He spoke about the denudation of the Himalayas as early as 1928. </p>



<p>Making people aware of the impending ecological hazards was his spiritual mission. He published extensively and raised red flags about the environmental crisis.<a href="#_ftn31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Bhagat ji published his pamphlets on recycled paper and distributed them free of cost. He also organized many tree plantations and environmental awareness campaigns.<a href="#_ftn32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>



<p>Bahgat Ji founded a charity home called Pingalwara, which means home for the destitute. He died in 1995, but the Pingalwara Society carries his legacy forward. Pingalwara is running a zero-budget farm and collaborating with farmers on organic farming. It has planted 90,000 trees in India.<a href="#_ftn33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> The <em>Kheti Virasat Mission </em>(meaning Agricultural Heritage Mission), a civil society group dedicated to organic farming and founded in 2005, is another organization that has invoked the Sarbat da Bhalaa ideal and established a holistic model of advocacy working with various stakeholders to promote agroecology in Punjab. </p>



<p>Their work extends beyond farming to women empowerment, forests, ecology, and resource management. Their focus is sustainability within the socio-cultural framework of Punjab.EcoSikh, which came into existence in 2009 in response to an initiative of the United Nations Development Program and the Alliance of Religions and Conservation, works globally and has built an impressive network of environmental programs. It provides guidelines for environment-friendly religious processions and biodegradable plates for customary food distribution. Besides working with the Green Pilgrimage Network (GPN), a global collaboration of 28 pilgrimage sites worldwide to promote environmental care by reclaiming the sense of place, it is also active in interfaith environmental initiatives. </p>



<p><em>Disjuncts and Gaps</em></p>



<p>Punjab is primarily an agrarian economy. According to the official statistics of the Punjab Government’s Department of Forests and Wildlife Preservation, the state&#8217;s forest coverage is 6%. Expansion of agricultural land and developmental projects are responsible for this dismal proportion. Environmental organizations are, therefore, working earnestly to restore the green zone. However, many other severe environmental challenges need urgent attention. </p>



<p>One of the most pressing issues facing Punjab, the breadbasket of India, is the depletion of groundwater and unsustainable farming practices resulting from the Green Revolution of the 1970s. According to Saryal and Saryal, state farmers were misled by subsidies and federal food procurement policies to rely heavily on water-intensive wheat and paddy farming.<a href="#_ftn34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> &nbsp;This overuse of groundwater, fertilizers, and pesticides has resulted in soil and water contamination, as well as a water crisis, high cancer rates, and an alarming number of farmers&#8217; suicides. Prill also points out the incongruity of social practices like lavish weddings, materialistic lifestyles, and the growth of motor vehicle usage among Sikhs.<a href="#_ftn35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;She adds that expensive tractors and combine harvesters contribute to high fossil fuel combustion.</p>



<p>The rise of plastic pollution results from a mindless consumption culture, which is opposed to the ideas of restraint and contentment. While the tradition of washing dishes manually is intact in Punjab’s gurdwaras, plastic plates, cups, cutlery, and mineral water bottles are comparatively more prevalent in events outside gurdwara and among diaspora Sikhs. The devotees quote numerous verses extolling nature but inadvertently overlook the impact of their plastic use on land, air, water, and other earth species. </p>



<p>Prill observes that Sarbat da Bhalaa has often been quoted in socio-economic justice but not explicitly in the ecological context.<a href="#_ftn36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> This vast gap needs to be filled with the help of religious leaders by emphasizing the direct relation between our consumption habits and the environmental state. An environmental activist from Punjab confided in the author how challenging it was to fight the plastic demon compared to organizing tree plantation campaigns. Her NGO, Action Group Against Plastic Pollution (AGAPP), submitted a letter of appeal to the Akal Takht Jathedar—the supreme Sikh authority, like the archbishop— and Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee—the organization managing gurdwaras in Punjab—in this regard in November 2023. The AGAPP, invoking the Sikh ideal of Sarbat da Bhalaa, has requested these authorities to lead the Sikh community in refraining from using single-use plastic. </p>



<p><em>Sri Harmandir Sahib</em> (known as the Golden Temple) is the pre-eminent Sikh spiritual site in Amritsar— one of the prominent sites in the GPN. It holds the same place in the Sikh community as the Vatican does for the Catholics or Mecca for the Muslims. The fireworks display in its arena conflicts with the interests of the GPN since it causes air and noise pollution, besides eroding its gold plate and marble. </p>



<p>Although the number of occasions and fireworks has downscaled over the last decade, the idea of fireworks is still questionable and has implications for the community. The supreme religious authority figure in Sikhi is <em>Jathedar </em>of <em>Akaal Takht</em>, the Sikh spiritual and temporal center located in the precincts of Sri Harmandir Sahib. If he issues a proclamation to abandon the fireworks display in Sri Harmandir Sahib and urges the Sikh community to refrain from crackers, it will serve as a great example of upholding Sikh environmental ethos. Both Sikh and Hindu communities cause obnoxious air pollution in Punjab on the night of <em>Divali/ Bandi Chhod Divas </em>by exploding firecrackers, which can be curbed by sending a practical, positive message of cracker-free holiday from the holy shrine. </p>



<p><em>Future Directions</em></p>



<p>The sense of mystique and beauty associated with the creation has been superseded by the modern, reductionist view of the capitalist culture today.<a href="#_ftn37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Many spiritual traditions, however, use wonder and enchantment as ways of knowing. Therefore, they can play a significant role in reviving the full appreciation of nature. This appreciation, or eco-aesthetics, must extend beyond the sensual experience. The sense of wonder and awe (<em>Vismaad)</em>in Sikh scripture holds epistemological value. </p>



<p>Nature symbolism has been profusely employed to induce Vismaad in Sikh scriptures. It is important to emphasize this interconnection between all manifestations of nature and Vismaad. A rift implies serious environmental repercussions. For example, Prill describes Guru Nanak’s composition <em>Barah Maha </em>(poetry on the theme of months) as an impressive portrait of the pre-modern Punjab ecosystem.<a href="#_ftn38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> &nbsp;Each passage, corresponding to a month, vividly paints the ambiance, flora, and fauna: “We hear of the blossoms and the bumblebees of springtime and the greenery, snakes, and mosquitoes of the monsoon season; in the summer, the blazing sun scorches the ground.”<a href="#_ftn39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> However, the difference between this imagery and the current Punjab climate is noticeable. This distorted state of nature reflects the erosion of the human mind.</p>



<p>The law of reciprocity and symbiosis sustaining the complex web of life has not yet been deconstructed fully and explicitly by Sikh religious leaders. As pointed out in an earlier section, Sikh theology can be understood around Hukam and haumai. Prill<a href="#_ftn40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> observes that haumai, or egocentrism, is the root cause of environmental destruction, but this aspect has not been fully integrated into the Sikh environmental rhetoric. </p>



<p>Shiva remarks that separation is the key feature of capitalist values.<a href="#_ftn41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> It not only alienates humans from nature but also humans from each other on the lines of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. This alienation causes all violence in mind and actions. The leaders and educators engaging with Sikh environmentalism must place haumai, or the idea of separation, in the center stage of capitalism and consumerism. </p>



<p>Ecological catastrophes are born of short-sightedness. McMichael contrasts the short-term ‘economic time’ with ‘geochemical-biological time controlled by the rhythms of nature’ by showing how shrimp aquaculture destroys coastal mangroves.<sup> <a href="#_ftn42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></sup> &nbsp;He concludes that the seed of the past is always buried in the present. Gurbani echoes this insight: “Do not indulge in the wrongdoing at all; use thy foresight to see [the consequences].” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%A6%E0%A8%BE">ਮੰਦਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%82%E0%A8%B2%E0%A8%BF">ਮੂਲਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8">ਨ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%9A%E0%A8%88">ਕੀਚਈ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%87">ਦੇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B2%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%80">ਲੰਮੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%A6%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BF">ਨਦਰਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B2%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%90">ਨਿਹਾਲੀਐ </a>॥ (SGGS, M.1, <em>Aaasaa,</em> 474). </p>



<p>It will, therefore, be a great initiative to have emerging Sikh scholars and leaders in seminaries study basic environmental science, political discourses on the environment, policies, and different eco-philosophical traditions. They can then explicitly address the environmental crisis by presenting Sikh environmental ethics more eloquently and persuasively. Their social and political clout in the community will make a huge difference in saving the planet. </p>



<p>Educators in Sikh schools in Punjab and beyond and those engaged in non-formal sectors can also use faith-based approaches in their critical pedagogies. They can use ecocriticism from the lens of Sikh philosophy. Singh and Kaur define ecocriticism as a theory that makes people aware of their contribution to environmental devastation.<a href="#_ftn43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> It examines literature from an ecological perspective. </p>



<p>The authors clarify that ecocriticism is not confined to how a lion, a tree, or a flower is depicted in literature. Instead, it focuses on the overall representation of nature in cultures and communities. They conducted an ecocritical study on William Wordsworth (1770-1850) and Bhai Veer Singh (1872-1957) &#8211; The giants of English and Punjabi poetry, respectively. Though they lived apart in time and space, their poetry is a lighthouse for all nature lovers and those who seek ecological awareness in literature. William Wordsworth profusely registered his protest against distance from nature in the wake of industrialization in ‘The Excursion’:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When on the darker side</p><p>Of this great change, I look, and there</p><p>Behold such outrage done to nature as compels</p><p>The indignant power to justify herself;</p><p>Yea, to avenge her violated rights,</p><p>For England bane (412).</p></blockquote>



<p>In Bhai
Veer Singh’s poetry, one cannot help but notice his deep fascination with
nature. </p>



<p>In the
vein of Saint Francis of Assisi, he addresses Mashobra— a hilly paradise in the
Himalayas—as a brother.&nbsp; In another poem,
<em>Brichh </em>(the tree), he gives voice to
a tree to criticize deforestation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>O selfish owners of the land,</p><p>Why do you fight us?</p><p>We don’t grow out</p><p>We grow tall and straight.</p><p>Our rings and breadth</p><p>Extend only in space;</p><p>We take but a palm of land,</p><p>Even then, you grudge us?” (415)</p></blockquote>



<p>Bhai Veer
Singh is deeply revered in Sikh circles. He was a soul imbued in divine love.
His poetry can inspire the masses to protect nature. More scholars need to look
in this direction, as the interdisciplinary nature of ecocriticism can be a
creative mode of environmental education.</p>



<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>



<p>Although a gap between theory and practice has existed in all ages and civilizations, it cannot be a ground for rejecting ideals and values advocated by different faith systems worldwide. The fact that people have not always lived up to these ideals cannot and should not negate the significance and implications of these lofty ideas.<a href="#_ftn44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> The fact that a large section of society still draws their inspiration from religion has significant implications for solving the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. </p>



<p>Therefore, Sikh religious leaders, scholars, and teachers must respond proactively and creatively in working with activists, scientists, lawyers, politicians, and educationists to mobilize resources and motivate people for environmental action. This requires a systematic collaboration among all stakeholders to rewrite and propagate Sikh environmental ethics in the new age language for the action to gain momentum.</p>



<p>Sikhi
encompasses more than individual liberation and does not promote denial of the
world around us. Its rich traditions and history reflect the belief that true
transcendence can only be achieved by embracing the realities of our world and
actively participating in its evolution. This is why religious fervor has often
been present in social and political movements from Punjab, such as the massive
2020 farmers&#8217; protest. There is a tremendous opportunity for Sikh leaders and
scholars to tap into this faith-based approach and leverage spiritual resources
to benefit our environment. They can make a meaningful and lasting impact by
inspiring new ways of thinking, being, and acting rooted in the care of our
shared planet. </p>



<p>Guru Nanak called the earth a place to practice righteousness (dharma). In many Indic languages, the word &#8216;dharma&#8217; is used to denote both religion and righteousness. It serves as a reminder that many Eastern spiritual traditions, including Sikhi, believe that the essence of a religion lies in the practice of its vision of cosmic unity. Guru Nanak emphasized the importance of dharma in human life and did not simply refer to the Earth as a metaphor. It is his reminder to all of us to recognize the presence of the spirit in every life form, from the smallest unit (cell) to the most complex ecosystem, and to re-establish our connection with the Earth. </p>

<p><em>The following is the first installment of a two-part series.</em></p>



<p>Eco-philosophy, or ecosophy, offers insight into the relationship of living beings with their environment. The intersection of faith and eco-philosophy is known as religious environmentalism. This alliance of religion and ecology has been gathering momentum lately. Ikeke<a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> notes that science and policy alone cannot tackle environmental challenges. One must act responsibly with conviction, primarily rooted in philosophical ethics. So, he makes a case for mobilizing religious resources to solve the grand challenges of the environmental crisis. Tucker and Grim<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> also support incorporating cultural and religious values as critical aspects of environmental discussions.</p>



<p>The Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess introduced Deep Ecology, an eco-philosophy, in the 1970s. It is a holistic view of ecology based on harmony and equilibrium. This ecosophy challenges the mechanist and reductionist worldview and lends a transcendent dimension to the understanding of ecology. Naess advocates for wisdom focused on ‘deep experience, deep questioning, and deep commitment’ and situates the philosophy of ecology in ‘being, thinking, and acting.’ (<em>What is Deep Ecology</em>, n.d.). </p>



<p>These are all hallmarks of religion, which has always acted like a lighthouse for human civilization. The existential wisdom about the connection among different entities of the cosmos has long been enshrined in world religions and other ancient spiritual traditions.</p>



<p>Although much has been written about the eco-philosophy of different religions, it is a pity that some philosophies have either been omitted or inadequately and inaccurately represented in scholarly literature. It is a severe loss and epistemic injustice when people are deprived of particular ideological wisdom. For instance, despite being the fifth-largest religion in the world, Sikhi<a href="#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> is still not very well represented in academic discourses. According to Prill, Sikh environmentalism has received scant scholarly attention despite its potential to contribute significantly to ecological rhetoric.<sup> <a href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></sup> </p>



<p>Donaldson points out that Jainism and Sikhi are conspicuously absent from the <em>Norton Anthology of World Religions</em>.<sup> <a href="#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></sup> She remarks that these traditions have typically been relegated to the “footnote” status. Likewise, Sikhi is inadequately represented in Houston Smith’s The World Religions as a three-page appendix to the 75-page chapter on Hinduism. Jainism is missing altogether in this volume. The scholars are yet unprepared to address their philosophical insights. </p>



<p>Therefore, this essay explores Sikh environmental ethics as deduced from its eco-philosophy. It follows a thematic organization to discuss various aspects of its ecological theology. It attempts to retrieve wisdom enshrined in Sikh theological sources to examine and reevaluate their environmental significance and implications. It further critiques the reconstruction of this wisdom in practice to meet the current environmental challenges. Finally, reviewing all the gaps and misinterpretations, it offers suggestions for examining the intersection of Sikh ecosophy with other disciplines, such as education, science, politics, and literature.</p>



<p><em>Historical Context of the Sikh Faith and Scriptures</em></p>



<p>The Sikh religion, with an estimated 26 million followers, originated in Punjab in the 15th century. Following the division of Punjab between India and Pakistan in 1947, it is now the world&#8217;s fifth-largest religion. Its origin dates back to Guru Nanak&#8217;s <em>avatar<strong>[2]</strong></em> in 1469, and it flourished under nine successors (Gurus). In 1708, the tenth spiritual master, Guru Gobind Singh, installed <em>Sri Guru Granth Sahib </em>(SGGS)<em>,</em> the compilation of revealed teachings, as the eternal living guru. </p>



<p>The verses of this holy text<em>, </em>a collection of the compositions of six gurus and other saintly figures alluding to Hindu and Muslim traditions, are called <em>Gurbani</em>. It is a multilingual text in <em>Gurmukhi, </em>the literaryscript of the Punjabi language in India. As a living embodiment of the founder masters, it is ceremoniously enthroned on a high seat under a canopy. </p>



<p>Singh defines Sikhi as an independent and autonomous prophetic religion, not a blend or mix of other creeds or religions.<a href="#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. He establishes its validity as a complete and whole faith using scientific inquiry, thereby rejecting the arguments that it is a derivative of Hinduism or Islam. According to Singh, Sikhi is the only prophetic religion of the East. In his scholarly essay about the basics of the Sikh faith, he explains the three principles that define Sikhi&#8217;s essence. </p>



<p>He argues that the absence of a separation between matter and spirit, the ability of humans to participate in evolution consciously, and the ultimate goal of aligning God-consciousness with earth consciousness make Sikhi unique.<a href="#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> These principles ensure that Sikh ontology and theology are relevant to worldly matters. </p>



<p>Many theological sources,
including SGGS, <em>Dasam Granth</em> authored
by Guru Gobind Singh, <em>Janam Saakhis </em>(historical
accounts and anecdotes from the lives of the Gurus), compositions of Bhai
Gurdas ji, and others, are in the Gurmukhi script. These texts cover Punjabi,
Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, and other vernacular languages. English translations
may not capture the original texts&#8217; true spirit and subtleties. However,
efforts have been made to convey the general meaning faithfully. The
translations have been sourced from reliable sources and occasionally modified
to retain the original connotation.</p>



<p><em>Methodological Approach and Conceptual Framework</em></p>



<p>Tucker and Grim observe that the scale and complexity of the environmental crisis require a fresh approach to understanding religious traditions, teachings, and ethics and applying them to contemporary situations.<a href="#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> They suggest a threefold methodological approach to resolve this matter—retrieval, reevaluation, and reconstruction. Retrieval is a scholarly investigation of scriptures or historical sources to discover religious perspectives on the environment. It clarifies how ethics have been translated into practice through rituals, customs, and traditions. </p>



<p>Reevaluation evaluates the relevance of traditional teachings to contemporary circumstances: What is the significance of nature? What is the worldly versus transcendent orientation of the faith? What ideas promote ecologically sensitive attitudes and behaviors? Reconstruction is the creative adaptation of traditional ideas to the current circumstances, using modern modes of expression without challenging the essence. </p>



<p>It must be noted, however, that reconstruction is the most sensitive part of religious environmentalism since <em>who </em>interprets <em>what</em> and <em>how </em>is the most critical part of the creative dialogue between the practitioners and scholars of religion.<a href="#_ftn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Singh suggests that auto-interpretation is a valid way to comprehend and value religious wisdom.<sup> <a href="#_ftn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></sup> This approach involves analyzing the religion&#8217;s central precepts, practices, and history without relying on external theories. </p>



<p>Sikhi does not endorse any hetero-interpretation based on ideas not aligned with its core teachings. Therefore, the author, a practicing Sikh, has leveraged her study of the scriptures, oral discourses by Sikh scholars, and academic papers in deference to the essence of Sikh doctrines to research the topic hermeneutically. </p>



<p><em>Ecological
Inspiration in Sikh</em></p>



<p>Although there is no direct allusion to environmental ethics or ecology in SGGS, the scripture is prolific in nature symbolism and explicit references to natural phenomena, forces, and various species. Therefore, the verses enshrined are a rich source of ecological wisdom. Prill affirms that Sikhs find their ecological inspiration from SGGS by recovering wisdom from the verses and life stories of the Gurus, which serve as a parallel body of religious knowledge.<sup> <a href="#_ftn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></sup> &nbsp;</p>



<p>She adds that the hagiographical accounts are conveyed orally, though multiple textual sources are available. Pointing to the observation of Roger Gottlieb that the resource of eco-theology is “neglected parts of the tradition, reinterpretation of the familiar, the adaptation of the old to the unprecedented demands of the present, or radical innovation,”<a href="#_ftn12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> she emphasizes how certain verses and historical events in Sikhi are highlighted for environmental advocacy.<a href="#_ftn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>



<p>Singh presents the environmental orientation of the Sikh faith compendiously.<sup> <a href="#_ftn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></sup> &nbsp;He remarks that Sikhi does not view ecology and ethics as disjunct. They must be understood in the broader <em>dharma</em> (righteousness) context that enjoins humans to treat all creation respectfully. The premise of retrieval is best understood through a quote from the first Sikh morning prayer composed by the first master, Guru Nanak: “Dharma is the progeny of compassion that holds the earth patiently in place” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A7%E0%A9%8C%E0%A8%B2%E0%A9%81">ਧੌਲੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A7%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%81">ਧਰਮੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%86">ਦਇਆ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BE">ਕਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A9%82%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%81">ਪੂਤੁ </a>॥ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%96%E0%A9%81">ਸੰਤੋਖੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A5%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BF">ਥਾਪਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%96%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%86">ਰਖਿਆ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BF">ਜਿਨਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%82%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BF">ਸੂਤਿ </a>॥<strong> </strong>(SGGS,Jap, M.1, 3)<a href="#_ftn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. Sikhi’s explanation of the interconnected web of life can be interpreted in this context.  </p>



<p><em>Deep Ecology Characteristics</em></p>



<p>The theory of deep ecology proposed by Arne Naess in 1973 rejects the notion of nature as inanimate and subordinate. It sees intrinsic value in all things of nature and places humans in the organic scheme of a participatory universe. It calls for reevaluating our understanding of nature and the conception of the human self so that humankind can address environmental degradation at the grassroots level. Naess urges us to identify our ego self with the larger ecological self. Drengson<a href="#_ftn16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> clarifies that this is achievable by identifying with other living beings. </p>



<p>In other words, we must recognize the cosmic unity that binds all life and matter. Sikhi calls this cosmic principle or Divine Will/Command/Order as <em>Hukam</em>. It is Hukam that maintains harmony and equilibrium in the universe. When an individual functions in the ego mode, assuming a separation from other independent ego selves, it lays the ground for anthropocentrism. This intersects with the idea of <em>haumai </em>(egocentrism) in Sikh theology. Sikh ecology can, therefore, be studied through the [antagonistic] concepts of haumai and Hukam.</p>



<p>Since Hukam is the cornerstone of Sikh belief, Lourdunathan<a href="#_ftn17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> describes Sikhi as an ecosophical tradition. He points to the repeated assertion of the self-conceited nature of the human mind in SGGS. He elaborates that as the mind sees itself as separate from the rest of the creation, it loses the sense of integrity, which is at the root of ecological imbalance. Furthermore, he writes that SGGS obligates humans to live the ideals of justice and equality by declaring the earth a place for practicing dharma. </p>



<p>Declaring the earth thereby a sanctuary echoes the tenets of eco-philosophy.<a href="#_ftn18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> This world is a sacred place to be treated with reverence and care. The Sikh morning prayer Jap expresses it thus: “Nights, days, weeks, and seasons; Wind, water, fire, and nether regions; In the midst of these, He installed the earth as an abode for <em>dharma</em>. Upon these are placed the various species of beings; Countless are their names; their deeds and actions shall be judged” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%80">ਰਾਤੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%80">ਰੁਤੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A5%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%80">ਥਿਤੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B0">ਵਾਰ </a>॥<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%A3">ਪਵਣ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A3%E0%A9%80">ਪਾਣੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%85%E0%A8%97%E0%A8%A8%E0%A9%80">ਅਗਨੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B2">ਪਾਤਾਲ </a>॥<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%81">ਤਿਸੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%9A%E0%A8%BF">ਵਿਚਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A7%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%80">ਧਰਤੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A5%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BF">ਥਾਪਿ </a>ਰਖੀ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A7%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%AE">ਧਰਮ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B2">ਸਾਲ </a>॥ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%81">ਤਿਸੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%9A%E0%A8%BF">ਵਿਚਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%85">ਜੀਅ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%97%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BF">ਜੁਗਤਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%87">ਕੇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%97">ਰੰਗ </a>॥<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%A8">ਤਿਨ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%87">ਕੇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%AE">ਨਾਮ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%85%E0%A8%A8%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%95">ਅਨੇਕ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%85%E0%A8%A8%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%A4">ਅਨੰਤ </a>॥<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%80">ਕਰਮੀ ਕਰਮੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B9%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%87">ਹੋਇ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B5%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%9A%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%81">ਵੀਚਾਰੁ </a>॥ (SGGS, Jap, M.1,7).</p>



<p>Nature as a sacred and living
entity is another deep ecology principle that resonates with Sikh cosmology.
Prill<a href="#_ftn19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> and
Singh<a href="#_ftn20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
write that God is the Creator of the universe, who is immanent and transcendent
simultaneously, according to SGGS. Therefore, nature is sacred and real, not
illusory, as believed by some schools of thought on the Indian subcontinent.
While Prill<a href="#_ftn21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
seems unable to resolve the apparent ambiguity of ‘the world as a palace of
smoke’ referenced in SGGS and the reality of the creation, Singh clarifies that
the Creation (nature) is real by the immanence of her Creator. Still, it is
subject to decay and death.<a href="#_ftn22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> </p>



<p>The intrinsic value of nature, human and nonhuman life included, and the biocentric equality is a direct corollary of the holistic view of the living environment. Singh asserts that the expansion and regression of the Creation are governed by Hukam(the divine law), which ensures equilibrium in the cosmos.<a href="#_ftn23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> &nbsp;He narrates an anecdote to illustrate this: A devotee, Bhai Jiva, cooked and served food daily to Guru Angad Dev, the second guru. One evening, when a storm rose, he became anxious because he could not light a fire to cook. </p>



<p>He beseeched Guru to halt the storm, and the prayer was answered. However, the Guru turned His face away when the devotee brought Him a fresh meal the following day. The Sikh begged to know where he had erred. Upon this, Guru revealed that storms and rain bring sustenance to many living beings. God had intended to spread food grains through the wind to a remote place where many insects were starving. The devotee understood that he dared to violate the Hukam<em>, preventing</em> those beings from receiving nourishment. </p>



<p>SGGS illustrates the integrated web of life by describing the food webs and ecosystems: “Some eat meat, while others eat grass. While some relish delicacies, others live in soil and eat particles in it; Some live on air, and their food is in the air”&nbsp; <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BF">ਇਕਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%80">ਮਾਸਹਾਰੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BF">ਇਕਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%8D%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%A3%E0%A9%81">ਤ੍ਰਿਣੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%96%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਖਾਹਿ </a>॥<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BE">ਇਕਨਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9B%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%B9">ਛਤੀਹ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%85%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%8D%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%A4">ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਪਾਹਿ </a>॥<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BF">ਇਕਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%9F%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%86">ਮਿਟੀਆ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਮਹਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%9F%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%86">ਮਿਟੀਆ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%96%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਖਾਹਿ </a>॥<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BF">ਇਕਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%89%E0%A8%A3">ਪਉਣ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%80">ਸੁਮਾਰੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%89%E0%A8%A3">ਪਉਣ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BF">ਸੁਮਾਰਿ </a>॥ (SGGS, M.1, <em>Maajh</em>, 144).

<p>These colossal changes in geological time can be construed as consequences of ecological imbalance and the breaking of the food chain. Therefore, Guru Nanak ordains living in harmony with the Hukam, and interference in natural affairs is considered folly<em>. </em>This is an illustration of the reevaluation of Hukam applied to ecological conservation. </p>



<p><em>Panentheism</em></p>



<p>Sikhi is a panentheistic faith
that does not worship natural elements. The Sikhs are ordained to worship only
one Timeless Creator, although they consider everything a manifestation of the
Creator.&nbsp; SGGS has numerous verses that
speak of the Lord’s presence in one and all. One, for instance, says, “Out of
the same clay, the elephant, the ant, and many sorts of species are formed. In
stationary life forms, moving beings, worms, moths, and within every heart Lord
is contained” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%8F%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%B2">ਏਕਲ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%9F%E0%A9%80">ਮਾਟੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%81%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%9C%E0%A8%B0">ਕੁੰਜਰ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9A%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%9F%E0%A9%80">ਚੀਟੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AD%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%9C%E0%A8%A8">ਭਾਜਨ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B9%E0%A9%88%E0%A8%82">ਹੈਂ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AC%E0%A8%B9%E0%A9%81">ਬਹੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BE">ਨਾਨਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%87">ਰੇ </a>॥ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%85%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%A5%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%B0">ਅਸਥਾਵਰ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%97%E0%A8%AE">ਜੰਗਮ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%9F">ਕੀਟ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%97%E0%A8%AE">ਪਤੰਗਮ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%98%E0%A8%9F%E0%A8%BF">ਘਟਿ ਘਟਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%81">ਰਾਮੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BE">ਸਮਾਨਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%87">ਰੇ </a>॥ (SGGS, Naamdev, <em>Maali Gauda, </em>988).Prill<a href="#_ftn26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>

<p>Chahal proffers another
example to expand on the concept of Sikh panentheism<strong>:</strong> “From His state of absolute existence, He assumed the immaculate
form; from formless, He appeared in the form” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%85%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%97%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%8B">ਅਵਿਗਤੋ </a>.<sup> <a href="#_ftn28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></sup> However,

<p>The most recited quote from Guru Nanak’s composition Jap with an explicit environmental lesson is: “Air is Guru, Water is father, and the great Earth our mother” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%A3%E0%A9%81">ਪਵਣੁ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%97%E0%A9%81%E0%A8%B0%E0%A9%82">ਗੁਰੂ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A3%E0%A9%80">ਪਾਣੀ ਪਿਤਾ ਮਾਤਾ </a>&nbsp;ਧਰਤਿ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%81">ਮਹਤੁ </a>&nbsp;(SGGS, Jap, M.1, 8). Such spiritual affiliation with nature has implications for the ecological footprint of the Sikhs. It is meant to inspire Sikhs to act in an environmentally sensitive manner to avoid violating their sacred and tender relationship with nature.<a href="#_ftn29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Virk has elaborated on the concept of nature in his treatise <em>Man-Nature</em> <em>Relationship: The Sikh Perspective</em>.<a href="#_ftn30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> &nbsp;</p>



<p>He gives a historical background for Guru Nanak’s selection of the Arabic term <em>qudrat</em> over the Sanskrit one <em>prakriti</em> to speak of nature. He asserts this is a clear rejection of the Samkhya school of Indian philosophy, comparable to the Cartesian dualism of object and subject. He avers that Guru Nanak rejected the Vedantic philosophy that only God is real and His creation is only <em>Maya</em> or an illusion. Sikhi esteems nature as real and an abode of God. He notes that all species originating from the same source is a constant reminder of equality in SGGS, and this theological data is a pathway to intimacy with the Infinite and a springboard to ethical behavior.</p>



<p><em>Anthropocentrism or Ecocentrism?</em></p>



<p>As an
ideology, anthropocentrism believes in the centrality of human beings in the
scheme of existence.<a href="#_ftn31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
Conversely, ecocentrism values all nonhuman forms for their worth. Thus,
ecocentrism assigns a meaningful identity to humans who are “in awe of life and
part of the greater planetary existence.” Therefore, an ecocentric approach
respects the web of life and attributes values to animals, trees, rivers, and
landscapes. Anthropocentrism, by contrast, is an egotistical stance.<a href="#_ftn32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>



<p>As
discussed before, the verses in SGGS explain the intricate web of life
delicately balanced by Hukam. How can humans be supreme in this philosophy when
God permeates all forms in the Universe, and the same Hukam governs everything
in the cosmos? However, mentioning Sikhi&#8217;s comparative emphasis on the human
body is crucial. This body is considered sacred and a privileged means to
ascend consciousness and merge with the Supreme. So much so that, according to
SGGS, even angels long for this body (<a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%87%E0%A8%B8">ਇਸ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%B9%E0%A9%80">ਦੇਹੀ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%89">ਕਉ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਸਿਮਰਹਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%87%E0%A8%B5">ਦੇਵ </a>) (SGGS,
Kabeer, <em>Bhairo</em>, 1159)<strong>. </strong>At the same time, there is a constant
reminder from the Guru that this lofty aim is unattainable without
acknowledging the presence of the Divine Light through all forms, without any
distinction whatsoever. </p>



<p>Though
the human is painted as a summum bonum of creation in Sikhi, it comes with a
caveat. The Sikh scripture frequently reminds the mind of the inherent flaws
that constantly threaten the vast potential of this gifted body. One example
would suffice to drive home this message: “The deer, the fish, the bumble bee,
the moth, and the elephant&#8211;each is destroyed by one flaw; what can be hoped
for one [human] who houses five incurable (lust, rage, greed, attachment, and
ego) vices within oneself?” <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%8D%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%97">ਮ੍ਰਿਗ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A9%80%E0%A8%A8">ਮੀਨ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AD%E0%A9%8D%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%BF%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%97">ਭ੍ਰਿੰਗ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%97">ਪਤੰਗ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%81%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%9A%E0%A8%B0">ਕੁੰਚਰ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%8F%E0%A8%95">ਏਕ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%96">ਦੋਖ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AC%E0%A8%BF%E0%A8%A8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B8">ਬਿਨਾਸ </a>॥ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AA%E0%A9%B0%E0%A8%9A">ਪੰਚ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A6%E0%A9%8B%E0%A8%96">ਦੋਖ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%85%E0%A8%B8%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A7">ਅਸਾਧ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%9C%E0%A8%BE">ਜਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%AE%E0%A8%B9%E0%A8%BF">ਮਹਿ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%A4%E0%A8%BE">ਤਾ </a><a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%95%E0%A9%80">ਕੀ </a>ਕੇਤਕ <a href="https://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=%E0%A8%86%E0%A8%B8">ਆਸ </a>॥ (SGGS, Sri Ravidas, <em>Aasaa</em>, 486).

<p>He probably wanted to highlight man&#8217;s anthropogenic behavior when he remarked, “Although anthropocentrism is respected…it is discussed in a different sense”<a href="#_ftn34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>&nbsp; because he does take note of human failure in the face of irresponsible behavior.

<p>As early as 2014, governmental officials in the city of Flint, Michigan made a series of decisions that would prove to have deleterious effects on the people and environment of Flint. As officials sought to make room in the budget, they decided to switch the city’s water supply to the polluted Flint River without a plan to treat the water appropriately. The fallout from citizens being poisoned has largely impacted the city’s Black population in disastrous ways. In fact, one study has found that:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analyzing health records from 2008 to 2015, researchers found that fertility rates in Flint dropped by 12 percent and fetal deaths rose by 58 percent after the water was switched to the Flint River in 2014. Additionally, babies who were born at full-term during the water crisis had lower birth weights. The lead exposure also increased the risk of hypertension for pregnant women and may have interfered with their choice of whether or not to breastfeed. Moreover, the health effects of lead exposure in children in Flint increased the risk of impaired cognition, behavioral disorders, hearing problems and delayed puberty.”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>



<p>It is clear that budget concerns were deemed more important than the health of Flint citizens, animals, and infrastructure. In this way, it seems that various levels of disabling events were enabled to take place.</p>



<p>Since the inception of this country, Black people have found themselves disabled for a variety of reasons. Some of these factors include genetics, environmental issues, brutality of all sorts, as well as systemic racism. This paper will primarily analyze the social implications of Black disabled people here in America, Christian messaging, and how they should shape environmental justice discourse. It is important to note that while Christianity is not the only religion that Black people practice here in America, it still represents a religion that the majority ascribe to (I will share more on this later in the paper.).<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is sufficient to say here that, while many Black Americans, while holding space for nuance, say that “they believe in God as described in their religion’s holy scripture (such as the Bible for Christians or the Quran for Muslims).”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&nbsp;As a Black, disabled, theologically trained man, I will utilize Black theologians, scholars, and artists to point to a model of environmental justice that includes those who are most marginalized by this ableist society. First, I will go more in-depth on my own positionality and the tools that I use to analyze Black disability. Next, I will talk about Black disabled bodies and environmental justice, and lastly, I will turn to looking closely at what is “Good News” to Black disabled bodies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>My positionality</em></p>



<p>It is always important for me, when writing or speaking on a given topic to note my social location. It is my hope that doing so allows for others to locate themselves and to note that I am absolutely biased in what I am thinking through. First, I am a disabled Black man who grew up in the southern part of Chicago. This is especially important because often there are assumptions that are made when Black folks speak about God and the universe. </p>



<p>Despite most of the people I grew up around having loyalty to the systems of the church, I did not. I did have ethics and a form of spirituality that I could never quite label though. I prided myself on being more moral than the Christians I knew around me. Second, after becoming a Christian later in life, I went on to study theology in a few different spaces and obtained Bible certificates, an MA concentrated on womanism/Black liberation theology, and am now in a PhD program for Religious Studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a Black theologian that has been positively impacted by womanist theology, I ground many of my observations with knowledge that I have gained from womanist ethicists and womanist theologians. Womanist scholar Delores S. Williams defines womanism in this way: “Womanists not only concern ourselves about the liberation of women, we also struggle along with Black men and children for the liberation, survival and positive quality of life for our entire oppressed Black community.”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>&nbsp;This definition is beneficial to me as I write about Black disabled bodies, and environmental justice. I am clear,&nbsp;&nbsp;in approaching the topics of environmental justice and Black disability, that I am seeking for the liberation and thriving of all people. A womanist lens helps to keep me grounded in my research and writing. I bring forth the knowledge and beauty of Black disability even as I strive alongside other Black bodies to create a future that is full of liberation and life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Definitions of Environmental Justice and Disability</p>



<p>In the quest for environmental justice, it is essential that we start from some sort of working definition of the term as well as how we think of disability. According to the United States Protection Agency, environmental justice is defined as</p>



<p><em>Environmental justice</em>&nbsp;means the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment so that people:</p>



<ul><li>are fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects (including risks) and hazards, including those related to climate change, the cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens, and the legacy of racism or other structural or systemic barriers; and</li><li>have equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn, grow, worship, and engage in cultural and subsistence practices.<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></li></ul>



<p>This definition serves to ground us because it points to an equitable outcome for all human beings. Environmental justice work should be about providing an equitable world that allows every person, regardless of status, to have a healthy environment. Human beings being able to enjoy the benefits of an environment that allows them to work and play in a sustainable way should be paramount to how we define the contours of environmental justice.</p>



<p>Now that we have a starting place to consider environmental justice, it is also important to note how we think of disability for the rest of this paper. According to the CDC, disability can be defined as “any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation) and interact with the world around them (participation restrictions).”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This definition is crucial as we consider invisible and visible disabilities. While our society is just now beginning to make headway in considering the ways that visible disabilities impact our society and one another, there is so much work to be done in considering the full spectrum of disabled bodies. Some live in immense pain while others do not. Some experience their disability as a superpower while others are ashamed of their disability. No two people are the same and as such, we must consider nuance when we speak of disabled peoples: particularly Black disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Black people are disabled at a higher rate in the United States than any other ethnic group. Recent studies show that one out of every four Black people live with some sort of disability.<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>Sometimes, when I speak at academic conferences, I like to poll the crowd before I give this statistic. I ask people what they would guess our disability rates are. I also poll the crowd and try to get them to name the amount of Black disabled people they know in academia, in movies, and personally. </p>



<p>I do this exercise to frame the disparity between the statistics rates of Black bodies and the representation/space that Black disability takes up in the imaginations of people. Black people being disabled in such a way is massive for realizing that in a crowd of Black people, quite a bit are disabled in one or multiple ways. Some would label this positively. Still others are reeling from systems and environments that have disabled them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does all of this have to do with environmental justice? In the journey to create policies that seek to remedy the damage that humans have done to the planet, it is imperative that we consider all bodies when we protest, write, and legislate. In my earlier exercise to poll different crowds about Black disabled people, it is apparent that Black disabled people are rarely considered. If this is the case in a teaching venue, one can easily see how this effect is amplified on a larger scale. If Black disabled people aren’t even considered, then of course they aren’t at the table making decisions. </p>



<p>During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when churches and many organizations were forced to shut down, many expressed their confusion at how to create meaningful online platforms. As so many scrambled for answers, there seemed to be an ignorance of the ways in which disabled people have had to create community with one another; how they had been forced to do this for many years. Disabled people have wisdom to share. I offer these concrete examples because perhaps, if disabled people, particularly Black, were asked to help form creative online spaces, we all could have coped with the pandemic in more engaging ways. Rather than trying to dream of something from scratch, churches could have asked their chronically ill to explain the ways that they have had to cultivate community when they cannot gather in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>America as a Disabling Apparatus</p>



<p>I want to underscore how disability manifests for Black bodies as America itself is a disabling apparatus. The way this nation was colonized and made great was through brutalization, maiming, and the spread of disease. Productivity and success remain as American ideals that measure the success of individual and communal lives. It is because of this that I say that America is a disabling apparatus. How does this apparatus influence the lives and futures of Black people? Dr. Rheeda Walker wrote a book entitled&nbsp;<em>The Unapologetic Guide to Black Mental Health</em>&nbsp;where she discusses, among other things, the different avenues that this country employs to harm Black bodies. </p>



<p>She notes that “African-American men, women, and children are mistreated and sometimes killed for doing normal things that white people do or could do without a second thought or consequence.”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>&nbsp;This reality impacts Black mental health in very deleterious ways, as Black people are forced to live in a world where anxiety and fear are commonplace. Racism, in its many forms, has a maiming, disabling, and disheartening effect on Black bodies in this nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inherent in writing about America in this way is the knee-jerk reaction that many face to defend America as no more brutal than any other developing nation. It is at this juncture that I must readily say that the systems of heteronormativity, ableism, and racism that have been embedded into this country were created. They are not simply a byproduct of evolution. The rise in work fatigue and mental health breakdown in America cannot be ignored as Americans, irrespective of ethnicity, eventually break down over the demands that the workforce place upon their bodies and minds. </p>



<p>If this weren’t a problem, then the American Psychological Association would not have noted in recent studies that “Nearly 3 in 5 employees reported negative impacts of work-related stress, including lack of interest, motivation, or energy (26%) and lack of effort at work (19%).”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&nbsp;These statistics are compounded when people face work exhaustion, stress, fatigue, and racial discrimination. Bodies develop disabilities that they weren’t born with simply due to the way this country chooses to legislate work.</p>



<p>In light of the disabling apparatus known as America, I point to a model that aims for progress. Black disability politics can help us as we put disability, race, and gender into conversation with environmental justice. Dr. Sami Schalk defines Black disability politics as “anti-ableist arguments and actions performed by Black cultural workers. Black disability politics are often performed in solidarity with disabled people…they prioritize an understanding of disability within the context of white supremacy.”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Black disability politics and Black disability studies are frameworks that have been and are being used by scholars and activists today to study the relationships between Blackness and disability. Furthermore, organizations such as the Black Panthers were early performers of Black disability politics. In Dr. Schalk’s book, she does extensive work to explore the history between the Black Panthers and the ways in which they fed needy people, strengthened families, and fought for the disabled. Her work clearly shows that even in the 1970s, the Black Panther Party was not ignorant of the rights of Black disabled bodies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Good News for Black Disabled People.<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>



<p>In Christianity, the crucifixion of Jesus has been a place to rally many to view suffering and resurrection. Pain and discomfort can be seen as sacramental and desirable by some within Christianity. Researcher and scholar Robert Orsi, in his book&nbsp;<em>Between Heaven and Earth</em>, does a phenomenal job of looking at some of the history of Catholicism, suffering, and disability. He makes note of the ways that people have utilized the Bible to understand disabled bodies and any suffering that they may go through. </p>



<p>At one point he notes that a common thought was that “pain was a ladder to heaven.” And in another place he notes a common phrase that “God always has a reason for sending pain.”<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>&nbsp;While it would be beyond the scope of this writing to trace the entire history of pain, suffering, and disability within Christian history, I bring some of Orsi’s thoughts here to broach the topic of how disabled people have been treated throughout history in relation to Christianity. Many have been ignored, some have been incorporated into churches for menial tasks, and still others have been treated as sinners who have displeased God in some way.<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>



<p>While the predominant message of the Good News that Christianity seeks to provide revolves around Jesus’ suffering and disabling marks, perhaps it is time to consider those who are already disabled. What happens when those who are or who have been made disabled take a seat at the foot of the Cross hypothetically speaking? Good News to these bodies is not that they are invited to suffer more with Jesus. This society, built around ableism, heteronormativity, and racism has already made life harder for these bodies. Instead, a spirituality that calls them into the resurrecting life<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&nbsp;is truly Good News.<a href="applewebdata://CA40B908-8200-4D11-9AEF-E6AF3968B253#_ftn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>&nbsp;In this resurrecting life, Black disabled people are consulted as society is reshaped in a way that makes a thriving environment for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On this resurrected life, I must point out the Christian doctrine of salvation. Many write about and speak about salvation in terms of what God saves humanity from, namely, sin, death, and hell. Fear of punishment in an eternal lake of fire aligns perfectly with the need for salvation. In the spirituality and the lived experiences that Black disabled people have to offer, hell is not the primary concern. </p>



<p>Instead, many Black disabled people would join with the vision of salvation that Delores Williams points to when she says that “Womanists and Black male liberation theologians can make a special contribution to this resurrection. They can provide ideas about salvation in a social context for Black Christians who want to understand how Black people can be saved in the material world.” This reflection is necessary because Black disabled people, and really all people, need to explore what salvation looks like in the material world. Rather than being mostly concerned with spirit and soul, we must work together to create a world that offers life. In this framing, Black disabled people are pointing out what we need to be saved from (systemic inequities, environmental hazards like global warming, poverty, etc.) and unto.</p>



<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>



<p>Black disabled people have fought for this nation in various wars, in the Civil Rights’ Movement, in the classroom, and in modern digital spaces. From Harriet Tubman to Fannie Lou Hamer, Black people have been working, against oppressive odds to make society equitable. I note these women because they were maimed and disabled in their quest to seek liberation. As we consider how to fight for environmental justice, it is important to listen to&nbsp;&nbsp;current Black disabled activists like Talila Lewis, Verton Banks, Lamar Hardwick, Shelby Lynch, Ola Ojewumi, and Keith Jones. </p>



<p>Not all of these activists claim an expressly Christian religious identity, but what is noteworthy is that they have a passion to make an inclusive society. And so, how can they be ignored in talks of environmental reparations and justice? Their voices, and the voices of many other Black disabled bodies are critical. Their reflections on community, the systems that disable, and how different progressive models of environmental justice impact real lives, are extremely nuanced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Black people in this country have had to make a way out of no way as they have utilized their spirituality and concept of God to advocate for their rights and the rights of their children as referenced earlier. At different intersections of American history, Black lives have served as a reminder that we are not all free and that our liberation is bound with the futures of one another. </p>



<p>In that same way, Black disabled people stand as a witness in this nation that things can be different. Black disabled people remind us that this society was made this way and that we can remake it. They remind us that we cannot fight for the environment outside of knowing the stories of real people. We can work together to create a world where people can flourish.</p>



<p>As we consider environmental justice, I offer another concrete way that Black disabled people, especially in the ones that claim Christian religious identity, can be helpful to society, and that is in framing priorities. When policies such as paper straws are enacted to cut down on plastic waste, who gets the power to say that this particular thing is a priority? The answer is typically found at the top of an organizational chart filled with able-bodied men who are not part of the global majority. These types of policies, that, while done with good intentions, can seem crass when compared to Black disabled people being harmed in public. Furthermore, when Black disabled people are met with poverty, racism, lack of access to wealth, job scarcity, and hunger, we must consider that disabled people can help us to frame the priorities that we have when we strive for equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I close this writing, I am reminded of a scene from Toni Morrison’s famous novel, Beloved. In this novel, Morrison creates a scene known as the Clearing. This beautifully depicted, woodland scene is a staging ground for Black men, women, and children to come and display their full selves. In this powerful scene, the main character, Baby Suggs, holy, someone who has been disabled, invites them all to come. </p>



<p>She reminds them that they are valuable, and worthy to be nurtured. As she watches them lament and dance, she states that “’Here, in this here place, we flesh; flesh that weeps, laughs; flesh that dances on bare feet in grass. Love it. Love it hard. Yonder they do not love your flesh.’” This beautiful depiction of a woodland scene, with bodies expressing themselves is a picture of what is possible in a reparations model that makes room for Black disabled people. Perhaps this Clearing scene will be a future scene where all bodies, regardless of ability can be at peace with nature and one another.&nbsp;</p>
