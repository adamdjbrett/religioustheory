Henry Allison’s account is an excellent example.1 As he proceeds to discuss Spinoza’s views concerning revelation, scripture and religion, the subject matter of the <em>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</em>, Allison writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spinoza&#8217;s general attitude to the claims of revealed religion is already clear from our consideration of the <em>Ethics</em>. Basically, belief in the teachings of traditional religions, as generally construed, is equated with superstition. The source of such belief is the imagination, and its hold on the mind of the masses is explained in terms of its connection with the passions of hope and fear. Hence, not only does Spinoza maintain that this belief lacks any rational basis; he also holds that the “virtues” which its proponents affirm-for example, fear of God, a sense of guilt, repentance, humility, and so on-are largely at variance with the dictates of reason.2</p></blockquote>
<p>This equation of religion with superstition is perhaps hasty. It is in the “Appendix to Part One” of the <em>Ethics </em>that Spinoza expounds on the nature, origin and consequence of an intellectual prejudice, the necessity of which is grounded in human nature. This prejudice is said to include a set of interelated ideas that constitutes what would normally be called religious belief. As expounded in the <em>Ethics</em>, Spinoza’s theory of religion might be considered merely an argument that “religion is a form of anthropomorphism.”3</p>
<p>Surveys of modern theories of religion either ignore Spinoza or misrepresent him. When his contribution is noted, we are told about his philosophical discreditng of classical theistic beliefs, which he sees as a form of intellectual prejudice, and of his establishment of a method of biblical criticism, which is celebrated as an heroic public attempt to discredit the authority of the bible.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Spinoza’s naturalistic account of religion as a social institution of (probably) indeterminable value is totally occluded by those beacons of secular Enlightenment. His account credits religion with making possible the overcoming of the horrors of tyranny and, illiberally (classically elitist yet modernly pluralist), founds democratic government on a necessary diversity of religious sensibilities, blames insufficient sectarianism for religious violence, defends democratic government as asymptotic to reason (without assuming rationality of participants) and requires it to exercise limited supervision over religion in the state).4</p>
<p>In a notable exception to the general silence, Roberto Cipriani begins his historical introduction to the</p>
<figure id="attachment_1062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1062" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" wp-image-1062" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Spinzoa-300x157.jpg" alt="Baruch Spinoza" width="464" height="243" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Spinzoa-300x157.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Spinzoa-768x402.jpg 768w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Spinzoa-270x141.jpg 270w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Spinzoa.jpg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1062" class="wp-caption-text">Baruch Spinoza</figcaption></figure>
<p>sociology of religion with the suggestive observation that the scientific study of religion is indebted to “Spinozism, that is, to the need to free religious studies from fideistic and ideological claims.”5</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cipriani sees it only as a contribution to biblical hermeneutics and ignores the naturalistic theory of religion Spinoza articulated in the <em>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</em>. Noting Spinoza’s avant-garde position, Cipriani observes that “Spinoza&#8217;s historical-critical method was directly linked to political questions designed to achieve a freer society, which would be open to new solutions, including a secular approach to religion.” As in other surveys there is no recognition of Spinoza’s own sociology of religion.6</p>
<p>All strands of the <em>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</em> argument converge on chapter 14, where faith is defined as the subjective state (of belief and passion) that leads a person to piety, in matters of justice and charity, as judged solely according to that person’s behavior.7  It is the task of chapters devoted to biblical hermeneutics (7-13) to establish that exhortation to piety, in obedience to the requirements of justice and charity, is the essential teaching of the bible,8 on which, alone, the bible is everywhere consistent and, by virtue of this consistency, exhortation to piety constitutes the “word of God” of which we can be certain that it has reached us uncorrupted.9</p>
<p>Earlier chapters (1-6), devoted to prophecy and miracles, ground religious authority in the ability to motivate ordinary people to act piously.10 This definition of faith aligns Spinoza’s ideas with what would become known as a Durkheimean functionalist approach to religion that can be extended to include aspects of Berger’s sociology–of–knowledge view of religion as “sacred canopy.”11</p>
<p>According to Spinoza, religion is stabilized superstition. This claim and all other elements of Spinoza’s theory of religion are present in the preface to the <em>Tractatus</em>, albeit cryptically at times. Rather than equating (philosophically or scientifically unfounded) religious belief with superstition, Spinoza sees religion as practically necessary to the solution of the problem of superstition.12 Understanding magical behavior in quasi-Malinowskian manner—as occurring at the limits of people’s power over circumstances and of their knowledge of the forces the effect them13 — Spinoza locates its origin in fear that is caused by convergence of the weakness and ignorance in which the lives of all humans begins.</p>
<p>The problem of superstition is not falsity of beliefs as such but their instability.14  So long as we adhere to practices merely on the basis of their fleeting ability to overcome fear by inducing hope, which ability is grounded merely in the fact that the proposed course of action has not been tried before, we move from one promise to another, never laying the foundation for a body of accumulated experience that may constitute a starting point of knowledge. One result is that “the multitude remains ever at the same level of wretchedness” and their culture fails to advance.</p>
<p>The other result is political instability that leads to endless wars. When people lack knowledge and wisdom and are barred from rising to them by the perpetual cycle of fear, hope and despair, the solution to the problem of superstition cannot be an overcoming of superstition but a modification of it. Religion, according to Spinoza, is a modification of superstition that ritualizes its form while retaining its content.15</p>
<p>Working on the level of emotion and imagination, the drama of ritual increases the power of any given superstition to alleviate fear and instill hope and shifts the ground of its efficacy, from the transient promise of the novelty of that which has not yet failed and caused despair, to the persuasiveness and authority of religion. The stability of ritual attenuates the problem of superstition, limits the credulity of the fearful ignorant and, thereby, creates a foundation for both political and cultural stability. These, in turn, make possible the advancement of knowledge and the exercise of reason, which, alone, solves the problem.</p>
<p>The two products of religion, born of the stabilization of superstition, are inversely related: the more enlightened a society, the less despotic its regime. The specific equilibrium a given society achieves between reason and superstition determines the proper role of religion in its affairs. Most fundamental, for Spinoza, is the enduring relation between religion and people’s perception of liberty.</p>
<p>Tyranny, the regime that most heavily relies on ignorance and in which people are the least free, is also the most unstable. A state of informers and secret police, trapped in mutual suspicion and fear, serially deposes its domineering dangerous rulers, unless their rule is sanctified by religion. In Tyranny, domination of all thought by religion 16  is both necessary and efficient as it induces subjects to police themselves, in a delusion of freedom, as a supreme virtue of piety, for the sake of salvation.17</p>
<p>The comforts that religion brings to tyranny—to both tyrant and subjects—are, however, themselves inherently unstable. As religion addresses our passions to motivate us to act as our society expects or requires, it collides with a feature of human nature that Spinoza’s naturalistic realism emphasizes: human beings are united by reason and divided by passions.18 Accordingly, by the nature of things, religion must be pluralistic enough to accommodate a wide range of divergent sensibilities and can aspire to uniformity only at a high level of abstract principles, not in specific implementation.19</p>
<p>Tyrannical mind control, which religion makes possible, is bound to cause profound hatred and to result in the ennobled sedition of the martyr because the stories and ceremonies that inspire some people’s piety may arouse contempt in others who are edified by beliefs and practices of a different kind. 20 Suppression of variants of “true religion”21 inspires the fearless rebellion of the righteous, which must be assiduously avoided.22 Accordingly, in direct opposition to Hobbes, Spinoza holds that insufficient sectarianism is a major cause of civil strife.</p>
<p>The only way out of this morass is to advance toward granting people freedom of judgment in matters of religion23<br />
— within the bounds set by the civil religion.24  Spinoza’s doctrine of the freedom of religion recommends a limited freedom that requires state supervision.25  State supervision is required for reasons of:</p>
<ol>
<li>preservation of political sovereignty,26</li>
<li>the fundamental irrationality in which religion is embedded, 27</li>
<li>the link between piety and the common good, 28  and</li>
<li>the superiority of reason (and of mechanism of political decision that approximate reason as much as human nature allows us to expect).</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1063 alignleft" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Solomons-Temple-300x206.jpg" alt="Solomons Temple" width="435" height="299" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Solomons-Temple-300x206.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Solomons-Temple-270x186.jpg 270w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Solomons-Temple.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" />Underlying all four reasons is a quest for the cultural and political unity that reason could provide had it been possible for a multitude of people to live according to reason. According to Spinoza, only an exceptional level of understanding—beyond mere scientific knowledge—can be motivationally effective in overcoming harmful divisive desires. Such understanding is all too rare to be politically significant. Consequently, even the well being of an advanced society depends the piety that religion induces by appealing to imagination and emotion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Spinoza claims that an approximation of the council of reason can be achieved in the political domain through non rational means. Such approximation is the virtue of large democratic legislative assemblies wherein “horse-trading” among agents motivated by diverse desires aims to secure a reliable majority. Diverse irrationalities and narrowly conceived self interests cancel each other out as they vie for wider and wider ad hoc agreement. The more comprehensive the coalition, the greater its approximation to what reason would have counseled.29</p>
<p>In a democracy, therefore, state supervision of religion is akin to sovereignty of reason over passion. The smaller the body in which sovereignty is vested, the less efficient the hidden-hand mechanism that protects it from folly. Nevertheless, Spinoza goes so far as to claim that oversight of religion by most forms of government is better than no oversight because governments are driven by interests of self preservation to act reasonably in pursuit of the public good.30</p>
<p>A theory of religion such as this should clearly have prevented Spinoza from discrediting the authority of the bible and there is no reason to think that it did not. The purpose of his critical study of the bible was not only to legitimize freedom of thought but also to protect the moral authority of the bible from unwise, shortsighted and irresponsible intellectual criticism.</p>

<li>R. Cipriani, <em>Sociology of Religion: An Historical Introduction</em>, trans. L. Ferrarotti (New York: De Gruyter, 2000).</li>
<li>Cipriani sees in Spinoza promise for the future but no substantive contribution to a theory of religion: “what is of interest here is Spinoza&#8217;s position with respect to later social scientifically oriented developments.” See: Cipriani, 14. Nancy Levene’s chapter on “Politics, law and the multitude” recognizes that religion is the necessary solution to the ineradicable problem of superstition but overreaches in claiming that Spinoza “does not . . . identify religion with superstition.” See: N. Levene, <em>Spinoza&#8217;s Revelation: Religion, Democracy, and Reason</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 152. Religion, for Spinoza, is a modification of superstition.</li>
<li>“According to our fundamental principle, faith must be defined as the holding of certain beliefs about God such that, without these beliefs, there cannot be obedience to God, and if this obedience is posited, these beliefs are necessarily posited.” See B. d. Spinoza Theological-Political Treatise, trans. Samuel Shirley (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 1998), 165. (Hence forth: <em>TTP).</em></li>
<li>On the basis of this core teaching Spinoza can argue for the unity of scripture as set in the Reformed canon.</li>
<li>Uncorrupted by opinions of those who received and transmitted it or by our deficient understanding of the ancient languages in which it was written.</li>
<li>“The teachings of Scripture that are concerned only with philosophic matters can be summed up as follows: that there is a God or Being who made all things and who directs and sustains the world with supreme wisdom; that he takes the utmost care of men, that is, those of them who live moral and righteous lives; and that he severely punishes the others and cuts them off from the good. Now Scripture establishes this simply by appealing to experience, that is, by its historical narratives; it does not provide any definitions of the terms it employs, but its language and reasoning is adapted to the understanding of the common people. And although experience can give no clear knowledge of these matters, and cannot teach what God is and in what way he sustains and directs all things and cares for men, it can still teach and enlighten men as far as suffices to impress on their minds obedience and devotion.” See: Spinoza, 68.</li>
<li>P. L. Berger, The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion (Garden City, NY: Anchor Books, 1969).</li>
<li>It is practically necessary but not absolutely. Individuals who can overcome superstition and the magical world that it entails through scientific learning and wisdom (a theoretical understanding that is motivationally effective), have no need for religion. Spinoza is not a utopian thinker and the quest for wisdom is not a Spinozan social policy.</li>
<li>. “If men were able to exercise complete control over all their circumstances, or if continuous good fortune were always their lot, they would never be prey to superstition. But since they are often reduced to such straits as to be without any resource, and their immoderate greed for fortune&#8217;s fickle favours often makes them the wretched victims of alternating hopes and fears, the result is that, for the most part, their credulity knows no bounds. In critical times they are swayed this way or that by the slightest impulse, especially so when they are wavering between the emotions of hope and fear; yet at other times they are overconfident, boastful and arrogant.” See: Spinoza, 1.</li>
<li>“It follows that superstition, like all other instances of hallucination and frenzy, is bound to assume very varied  and unstable forms, and that, finally, it is sustained only by hope, hatred, anger and deceit. For it arises not from reason but from emotion, and emotion of the most powerful kind. So men&#8217;s readiness to fall victim to any kind of superstition makes it correspondingly difficult to persuade them to adhere to one and the same kind. Indeed, as the multitude remains ever at the same level of wretchedness, so it is never long contented, and is best pleased only with what is new and has not yet proved delusory. This inconstancy has been the cause of many terrible uprisings and wars, for—as is clear from the above, and as Curtius, too, says so well in Book 4, 10—‘the multitude has no ruler more potent than superstition.’ So it is readily induced, under the guise of religion, now to worship its rulers as  gods, and then again to curse and condemn them as mankind&#8217;s common bane.” See: Spinoza, 2–3.</li>
<li>“To counteract this unfortunate tendency, immense efforts have been made to invest religion, true or false, with such pomp and ceremony that it can sustain any shock and constantly evoke the deepest reverence in all its worshippers.” See: Spinoza, 3.</li>
<li>Spinoza’s offenders of choice to exemplify absolute religious mind control are the Ottomans, of whom he says: “In this the Turks have achieved the greatest measure of success. They hold even discussion of religion to be sinful, and with their mass of dogma they gain such a thorough hold on the individual&#8217;s judgment that they leave no room in the mind for the exercise of reason, or even the capacity to doubt.” See: <em>Ibid</em>.</li>
<li>As Spinoza puts it: “Granted, then, that the supreme mystery of despotism, its prop and stay, is to keep men in a state of deception, and with the specious title of religion to cloak the fear by which they must be held in check, so that they will fight for their servitude as if for salvation, and count it no shame, but the highest honour, to spend their blood and their lives for the glorification of one man.” See <em>Ibid</em>.</li>
<li>“[B]y the laws of appetite all men are drawn in different directions.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 181.</li>
<li>“Hence it follows that a catholic or universal faith must not contain any dogmas that good men may regard as controversial; for such dogmas may be to one man pious, to another impious, since their value lies only in the works they inspire. A catholic faith should therefore contain only those dogmas which obedience to God absolutely demands, and without which such obedience is absolutely impossible. As for other dogmas, every man should embrace those that he, being the best judge of himself, feels will do most to strengthen him in love of justice.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 167. This is a theory of civil religion, which sets the boundaries within which all substantive religions must function. To the seven dogmas Spinoza lists in chapter 14 we need to add a prohibition of hate speech. Spinoza addresses the prohibition of preaching hate in many places: “Therefore it is also undeniable that he who by God&#8217;s commandments loves his neighbour as himself is truly obedient and blessed according to the Law, while he who hates or takes no thought for his neighbour is rebellious and disobedient (<em>Ibid</em>., 164); “[Faith] condemns as heretics and schismatics only those who teach such beliefs as promote obstinacy, hatred, strife and anger . . .” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 169.</li>
<li>“Now nobody questions that there is to be found among men a wide variety of temperament, that all men are not equally in agreement in all matters and are influenced by their beliefs in different ways, so that what moves one man to devotion will move another to ridicule and contempt.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 168.</li>
<li>True religion, for Spinoza, is any religion that inspires piety. He wrote: “God’s kingdom consists simply in the rule of justice and charity, or true religion . . .” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 220.</li>
<li>The following quotations from the concluding chapter of <em>TTP </em>are instructive. While referring to the philosophical free thinker, their reference clearly includes the pious ignoramous: [1] “Men in general are so constituted that their resentment is most aroused when beliefs which they think to be true are treated as criminal, and when that which motivates their pious conduct to God and man is accounted as wickedness. In consequence, they are emboldened to denounce the laws and go to all lengths to oppose the magistrate, considering it not a disgrace but honourable to stir up sedition and to resort to any outrageous action in this cause” (<em>Ibid</em>., 234–5); [2] “Those who are conscious of their own probity do not fear death as criminals do, nor do they beg for mercy, for they are not tormented with remorse for shameful deeds. On the contrary, they think it an honour, not a punishment, to die in a good cause, and a glorious thing to die for freedom. What sort of lesson, then, is learnt from the death of such men, whose cause is beyond the understanding of those of sluggish and feeble spirit, is hated by trouble-makers, but is dear to the hearts of all good men? The only lesson to be drawn from their death is to emulate them, or at least to revere them” (<em>Ibid</em>., 237) and [3] “[W]hen a contrary course is taken and attempts are made to deprive men of this freedom, and the beliefs of dissenters (but not their minds, which alone are capable of wrongdoing) are brought to trial, the exemplary punishment inflicted on honourable men seems more like martyrdom, and serves not so much to terrorise others as to anger them and move them to compassion, if not to revenge.” See:<em> Ibid</em>., 237– 8.</li>
<li>As Spinoza puts it: “Indeed . . . every man is duty bound to adapt these religious dogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in whatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them with full confidence and conviction.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 168. See also: “[It] is imperative to grant freedom of judgment and to govern men in such a way that the different and conflicting views they openly proclaim do not debar them from living together in peace.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 236.</li>
<li>The legal status of religion in the United States is closer to that advocated by Spinoza than is commonly thought. While constitutional practice protects the freedom of religion and its unlimited diversity, the actual practice of religion is supervised through the tax code and the criminal law (e.g., the cases of the Unification Church, the Branch Davidians and the Peyote Way Church of God).</li>
<li>“[W]hether we have regard to the truth of the matter, or the security of the state, or the advancement of piety, we are forced to maintain that divine law, or religious law, also depends absolutely on the decree of sovereigns, who are its interpreters and champions. It follows that the ministers of God&#8217;s word are those who are authorised by their sovereign to teach piety in the form that, by decree of the sovereign, is adapted to the public good.” See: Spinoza 227.</li>
<li>“[A]nyone who seeks to deprive the sovereign of this authority is attempting to divide the sovereignty; and as a result, as happened long ago in the case of the kings and priests of the Hebrews, there will inevitably arise strife and dissensions that can never be allayed.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 225).</li>
<li>“But in matters of religion men are especially prone to go astray and contentiously advance many ideas of their own devising, as is abundantly testified by experience. It is therefore quite clear that, if nobody were bound by right to obey the sovereign power in those matters which he thinks to pertain to religion, the state&#8217;s right would then inevitably depend on judgments and feelings that vary with each individual.” See <em>Ibid</em>., 189.</li>
<li>This is a matter both of authority and of a perspective of judgment: “[T]he practice of religion and the exercises of piety must accord with the peace and welfare of the commonwealth, and consequently must be determined only by sovereigns, who therefore must also be its interpreters” (<em>Ibid</em>., 219) and “[N]o one can exercise piety towards his neighbour in accordance with God&#8217;s command unless his piety and religion conform to the public good. But no private citizen can know what is good for the state except from the decrees of the sovereign, to whom alone it belongs to transact public business. Therefore no one can practise piety aright nor obey God unless he obeys the decrees of the sovereign in all things.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 223.</li>
<li>“[I]n a democracy there is less danger of a government be having unreasonably, for it is practically impossible for the majority of a single assembly, if it is of some size, to agree on the same piece of folly. Then again, as we have also shown, it is the fundamental purpose of democracy to avoid the follies of appetite and to keep men within the bounds of reason, as far as possible, so that they may live in peace and harmony. If this basic principle is removed, the whole fabric soon collapses.” See: <em>Ibid</em>., 184.</li>
<li>“[I]t is exceedingly rare for governments to issue quite unreasonable commands; in their own interest and to retain their rule, it especially behoves them to look to the public good and to conduct all affairs under the guidance of reason. For, as Seneca says, ‘violenta imperia nemo continuit diu’—tyrannical governments never last long.” See: <em>Ibid</em>.</li>

<p><em>Dreaming Innocence and “Americans”: the Charrua and Us </em></p>
<p>The circumstances of the development of Tillich’s <em>Systematic Theology</em> and his concept of Dreaming Innocence in particular belong to revolutionary political expectations and disappointments in Germany and to more muted but still decidedly left of center expectations and disappointments in the United States. As its anticipations in the dissertations on Schelling indicate, however, it is rooted in the post-Kantian idealism that coincided with the Napoleonic invasion of the multiple and complex tangle of small principalities and states forming the Holy Roman Empire, and the rise of bourgeois German nationalism.</p>
<p>The legacy of this movement is deeply ambiguous from the perspective of early twenty-first century struggles. J. Cameron Karter has argued at length that Kant’s system, particularly when read in relationship to his anthropology, creates a new form of Christian supersessionism in which whiteness becomes the “biological underpinning” of modernity, its “racial ground.” 1 Whiteness, for Kant, is the way that nature distributes “predispositions” for the deployment of universal Reason. Nature has equipped the human species with diverse “seeds” and “natural predispositions” that are activated only under specific environmental conditions, though once those seeds are “deeply rooted” through generations of reproduction, even environmental conditions do not immediately change them.</p>
<p>Whites, because they have been deposited in a “climatically moderate” region, are essentially or almost raceless 2 “a ‘race’ that is not quite a race.” 3 Other races are trapped in their particularity, whereas whites are just human. 4 This is especially true of black people. “In the Negro race, white flesh observes a race so mired in its particularity as never to be able to speak with universal force” 5 Whites – as opposed to Hindus, Americans (indigenous peoples of America), and Blacks – are capable of successful revolutions.</p>
<p>As Carter reports, Kant in a private note wrote that “all of the races will undergo an inner rotting or decay leading to their utter eradication, but never that of whites.” 6 Reason’s interest, never merely speculative but practical, is in assisting human beings to cultivate freedom. This means assisting them in building a cosmopolis that runs only on Reasons’s self-imposed laws, the laws of freedom and autonomy over against heteronomy. It means subordinating and eventually erasing the racial and cultural particularity that impede the building of this cosmopolis, sacrificing the particular to the universal.</p>
<p>Carter, echoing Charles Long, 7 detects this self-sacrifice of the particular working in Tillich’s notion of the cross, in which the particular man Jesus sacrifices himself to the Christ and is thus rendered <em>transparent</em> to God. If the analysis in this essay is correct, Tillich’s argument works against such transparency. The concept of Dreaming Innocence as Tillich develops it does not and cannot point to a transparent state. Further, the divine anxiety on which it finally lands raises questions about the degree to which transparency can be attributed to Tillich’s Jesus. But the mere name “Dreaming Innocence,” like the metaphor of transparency in Tillich’s Christology, cannot be freed of the <em>desire</em> for the kind of Enlightened Kantian identity that Tillich and his influences seek to escape.</p>
<p>While I think this desire is apparent in Tillich’s use of metaphor, I hope I have shown that Tillich’s notion of divinity is anything but transparent. It is grounded not in Kant but in Schelling’s response to the wreck of Kantian identity resulting from its internal conflicts, themselves a result of its collision with existence in the form of the “thing in itself,” radical evil, and the sublime. The transition from “Dreaming Innocence” to the Fall, from essential potentiality to actual existence, the “point of coincidence” between Fall and Creation, and the polarity within God that separates God’s will from its expression and then reunites them in Spirit, are all developments of his reading of Schelling.</p>
<p>The earliest Tillichian retelling of Dreaming Innocence and the Fall occurs in his first dissertation on Schelling. Here, it is not framed by the myth of Adam but by that of Creation and of Babel. Tillich, reading Schelling, writes that the completion of creation was humanity’s freedom. 8 God “did not desire the involuntary and untried blessedness of the creature.” Nevertheless, the Fall “does not occur because of any strict necessity,” and is not subject to a priori proof. It is a fact of existence, part of its structure but it is not, strictly speaking, necessary. Humanity’s freedom means that, like God in creation, humanity “can set the potencies in tension.” The “ambiguous nature of the first potency,” creator and destroyer of form, is in the human creature, and tempts that creature to be like God and to create and destroy. But “it is an error in man to believe that he can remain lord of the potencies (of dynamism and form) even when he has set them in motion.”</p>
<p>Instead, subjectivity, which is potential in every creature, attempts to negate the creature in whom it develops. “As long as man chooses to be the universal essence, he remains at the center, and is the lord of the potencies.” But when he wants to become lord of the potencies “as an individual being,” he becomes subject to “that which ought not to be,” or “that which ought to remain potential.” 9 Sin is neither exactly negative nor exactly positive but “that which is not but which desires to be,” and thus it is “a lie.”</p>
<p>The decision to sin results in the <em>dismemberment of consciousness</em> – its separation into multiple acts of synthesis and freedom, each of which is unconditional – and “the external, dismembered world arose, lacking inwardness,” the world of morally indifferent causal necessity. The “false” time also arose, the ever-repeating “unhappy and monotonous uniformity.” This world is “enslaved by the power of subjectivity” and “has fallen into the antithesis of particularity and abstraction,” into the world of categories of the understanding, of space and time. This is not a fall out of but into a Kantian world.</p>
<p>The essence from which humanity is separated in the Fall is not pure Reason but precisely what would have prevented Reason from closing in on itself, and thus precisely what prevents Kant and Fichte from completing the rational system. With the fantastic coincidence of universal freedom and transcendental apperception with multiple selves “comes the necessity of death.” 10 Death occurs because fallen humanity embodies two irreconcilable principles: “that which truly is and that which is not but which wants to be.” Ideality and reality are separated, and “God is no longer united with his will in the world.”</p>
<p>Once humanity asserts autonomous freedom over and against the causal chain of appearances that resists that freedom, “the will of the ground becomes an enemy to creatures and a destroyer,” the very principle of divine wrath. In trinitarian terms, “God is no longer related to the world as Father, for only by the generation of the Son in the world process is he Father. But on account of the Fall, the Son, that is, the will of the second potency (form and act) has lost his lordship over being.” 11 In order to regain it, “a new process is necessary,” the process of history.</p>
<p>Reading Schelling’s <em>Philosophy of Mythology</em>, Tillich retells the Fall from Schelling once again, this time as the beginning of history rather than as the end of creation. The previous iteration of the Fall generates “the possibility of history” rather than immediately actual history. 12 This is the “prehistorical” condition. It is “a situation in which nothing happens” outside natural functions, “a kind of eternity that only becomes time, that is, time past, by means of historical time.” Times in history are qualitatively different from each other because of the separation of prehistorical from historical time.</p>
<p>A prehistorical condition is a necessary myth because “every history, at the very least, presupposes a duality of principles that contend with each other.” The first potency keeps humanity in a condition “analogous to that total unconsciousness which prevailed before the beginning of the natural creation.” The “actualized ground” is “hostile to everything concrete, conscious, and spiritual” and preserves “a calm, undisturbed unity” and “an original, but relative monotheism” that does not oppose itself to polytheism. Tillich calls it “a monotheism mythologically conceived.” Prehistoric time is interrupted when the effect of the “second potency” on consciousness caused the severing of that unity, issuing in a “time of transition,” the proliferation of folk-gods, dissolution of humanity into “nations, tribes, and races” primarily by means of mythology. 13</p>
<p>The story of the Tower of Babel “manifests a genuine recollection of that moment when the second potency<img class=" wp-image-952 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Katherine_Cornell_The_Age_of_Innocence-238x300.jpeg" alt="katherine_cornell_the_age_of_innocence" width="299" height="377" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Katherine_Cornell_The_Age_of_Innocence-238x300.jpeg 238w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Katherine_Cornell_The_Age_of_Innocence-214x270.jpeg 214w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Katherine_Cornell_The_Age_of_Innocence.jpeg 603w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /> appeared from afar to consciousness, and mankind was seized by a fear of the loss of unity.” Every race thus “broke away from the common humanity” and “identified itself with that stage of the mythological process whose representative it was destined to become.” What is absent from Tillich’s otherwise quite detailed analysis of this text is what Schelling says about this divine act of racial apartheid. This is important because the ideological element of texts is often in what they leave out, 14 particularly when what they leave out is a materiality that they invert, Marx’s “camera obscura.”</p>
<p>In <em>Philosophy of Mythology</em>, Schelling writes that an “affection of consciousness” shook consciousness “in its ground” metaphorically struck the Tower of Babel and separated mythologies, languages, and races. Before this particular Fall, humanity’s “language is also fluid, mutable, not fully withdrawn from the others, such that to an extent, actually, various languages are spoken promiscuously, just as the old story assumes only a confusion, not immediately a complete separation of languages from each other.” 15 Overlapping words and phrases are the traces of this transition. In historical existence, humanity is prevented from this division of myth, language, and race by a “fear” of the loss of self.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not an external impulse, but rather the impulse of inner agitation, the feeling not to be the entire humanity, but rather only a part of it; and no longer to belong to the ultimate One, but rather to have fallen prey to a particular god or particular gods: it is this feeling that drove them from land to land, from coast to coast, until each saw itself alone and separated from all the foreign peoples and had found the place proper and destined for them. 16</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two races that stand as exceptions to the general rule that balances the separation of languages and myths with the dread that conserves their unity: the “African bushmen” and “savages in South America.” Here, Schelling cites 18th century Spanish Enlightenment naturalist, soldier, and surveyor Felix de Azara’s account of the people with whom he dwelt while waiting for the arrival of Portuguese counterparts to complete the demarcation of boundaries between Spanish and Portuguese territories. Schelling accurately cites Azara’s report, which characterizes these aborigines as</p>
<blockquote><p>without any type of community among themselves, fully like animals of the field, in that they acknowledge just as little a visible authority above themselves as an invisible one, and feel as foreign to each other as animals of the same species feel to each other. And the form a people just as little as the wolves or foxes form a people amongst themselves; indeed, they live more unsociably than some of the animals living and working in a community, such as the beavers, ants, or honey bees. Every effort to make them into a people – that is, to produce amongst them a social connection – would be in vain. Introduced by violent fiat, such a connection would be their demise; it would be a proof that a people not born immediately as a people can come into being through neither divine power nor human power and that where the original unity and community of consciousness is missing, none can be produced. 17</p></blockquote>
<p>Schelling argues that, based on this report, these people indubitably “are without religion.” 18</p>
<p>The role of the “exceptions” for Schelling is to show this to us: the “still only externally human population of South America” is not a survival of humanity’s earliest condition, “the first condition,” because “they refute most definitively the illusion of such a stupid primordial condition of the human species, in that they indicate that from out of such a condition no progress is possible.” 19 They are not humankind in a pre-lapsarian state, and they are not remnants of the indistinct unity of and relative monotheism of prehistory. They do not belong to Dreaming Innocence. Nor can they be justly regarded as a reversion of formerly enlightened peoples to barbarism. Even a degenerated nation still has marriage and family, moveable property, and contracts.</p>
<p>Political decay could not produce “such a state of absolute lawlessness, and &#8211; such a dehumanization (brutality), as is that in which those races are found that are without respect of any law, and any society, or any obligatory regulations, as well as without any religious ideas.” 20 Although they have never posed a problem for conventional thinkers, who “merely help themselves on with already used thoughts,” they give reason for a “thorough thinker” to pause, since such a thinker can find “no place for them.” “They seem to me to be only the tragic result of precisely that crisis from out of which the rest of mankind had saved the ground of all human consciousness, while this ground was fully lost for them. They are the still living testimony of the completed, utterly unrestrained dissolution; the entire curse of the dispersion has been realized in them – actually they are, properly, the flock that grazes without shepherd; and, without becoming a people, they were annihilated in just the crisis that gave the peoples determinate being.&#8221; 21</p>
<p>Schelling argues that “the condition preceding the emergence of peoples” still seen among these savages is “a condition of complete un-culture and animal coarseness, from which a transition to social development would never have been possible.” Indeed, one of these savages “has as little a past as any species of animal.” They are “the part of the original humanity in which all consciousness of unity has really perished.” So “we see in them what the whole of humanity would have become, if it had saved nothing of the original unity.”</p>
<p>As further evidence, Schelling cites the traces of original unity preserved in even the most diverse languages but lacking among Americans. “I doubt any material agreement between the idioms of this American population and the languages of peoples proper, just as I must leave undecided to what extent the study that has been devoted to these idioms was able to fulfill the hope in which it was undertaken, namely, to arrive at real, namely genetic elements of them.” 22</p>
<p>Instead of related idioms, “the language changes from horde to horde, even from hut to hut, such that often only the members of the same family understand each other; and not merely this, but rather the capacity for language itself seems with them to be near termination and extinction.” They speak only softly, he says, and they do not cry out “even when one kills them.” They hardly move their lips, and their speech is not accompanied by “a look that demands attentiveness.” Their language “hovers at the final frontier, beyond which it ceases entirely.&#8221; 23</p>
<p>For Schelling, these savages evoke “this fear, this horror before the loss of all consciousness of unity,” which is nothing short of the total disappearance “of all truly human consciousness” and which provided human peoples “with the first institutions of the religious type” and “even the first civil institutions.” The horror of this loss of humanity motivates “the formation of special communities” and the division into castes, “whose foundation is as old as history and common to all peoples.” The building of the Tower of Babel is not for Schelling a manifestation of hubris but rather a response to a crisis of dispersion – the threat of the loss of a center – but this impulse toward preservation of unity is simultaneously where “the separation begins, thus also the repulsion and exclusion.” 24 The Cyclops, for Schelling, is a mythic reminder of the “beginning toward those fully disbanded races” where “none show consideration for the others, in that they remain as foreign amongst themselves as animals do and are not bound through any consciousness to any sort of solidarity.”</p>

In the course of developing an account of philosophical history (not the history of philosophy) that includes a history of religion that may have inspired Tillich’s own early and late interest in the history of religion, Schelling, like Tillich, is trying to negotiate a tension in German politics and culture that dates to from the French Revolution, runs through the various alliances forged against an Enlightenment, revolutionary French domination in which German nationalism was born, and re-emerges in Tillich’s time as the tense alliance between the forces of romantic reaction and the forces of bourgeois revolution, and as the conflict of proletarian movements with both.</p>
<p>Schelling, whose life coincides with the beginning of the long nineteenth century in German-speaking areas of Europe, like Tillich, whose life corresponds with its abrupt end in World War I and its aftermath, is anxious about these tensions and, while ultimately affirming the revolutionary impulse, tempers this affirmation with a fear of the loss of a unity that can only be preserved by the powers of origin, by one’s distinct and particular cultural ground. Recall that Tillich’s Dreaming Innocence remains strangely contemporary with estranged existence as ontological anxiety and absolute utopia, and that its loss is one of the risks that makes self-transcendence so risky.</p>
<p>The kind of atheism for which Schelling cites Azara appears as “unbelief” in the <em>Systematic Theology</em>. 25 In unbelief, a human being “turns to himself and away from God in knowledge, will, and emotion.” 26 Unbelief is not a refusal to adhere to doctrine, but “the empirical shift from the blessedness of divine life to the pleasures of a separated life.” 27 In this context, it might also be important to recall that Tillich, in his lectures on utopia, rejects the notion that “those who are lowest in society in terms of power of being are the real bearers of utopia because of their discontent.” 28 Rather, the bearers of utopia are “those who have sufficient power of being to achieve advance.”</p>
<p>Tillich points to the role of the “highly cultivated” bourgoisie in the revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century to support this view. Here, he seems to be saying that effective ontological discontent depends on having at least one leg standing in the powers or origin, which here appear as a kind of stable ground from which revolution can be launched. Is Dreaming Innocence finally what separates a highly cultivated vanguard from the reign of particularity that overwhelms “those who are lowest in society”?</p>
<p>Schelling reads Azara’s account as testimony to just this kind of extreme separation, separation that encompasses language, religion, and culture, so that even false gods are abandoned without a shred of interest. Azara’s wild Americans, for Schelling, are not warnings to German readers about the ambiguous nature of the powers of origin, but conversely, monstrous testimony to the disintegrative powers of the demand, the revolutionary element within the origin, when the origin fails to restrain them. Azara’s religionless wild Indians were the Charrua, who by Azara’s own account, mounted a more effective resistance to Spanish invasion than the Aztecs. 29</p>
<p>He also notes that the Europeans who are captured by them “seldom decide to return to their parents and relatives” due to the freedom they have found among the Charrua. 30 Earlier, the Jesuit Lozano had expressed a horror at this “Geneva of these provinces” that calls to mind the horror that Schelling, though not Azara himself, expresses at the way of life he sees described in Azara’s text:</p>
<blockquote><p>There, not only indians, but Mestizos, blacks and even some Spaniards (a horrifying thought), who want to live without social constraints or fear of the righteousness of the judges because of their enormous crimes, which they continue and augment in Charrua lands, live in a fashion that is worse than the pagans. 31</p></blockquote>
<p>Gustavo Verdesio 32 notes that, despite the horror Lozano expresses at the Charrua’s failure to adopt Western juridical institutions and their mentality, generates a text that describes Charrua life in terms suggesting a kind of utopia. Verdesio is not asserting merely that this text might correspond to our own notions of utopia, but that it corresponds to Lozano’s own examples of European quasi-utopias. Lozano’s reference to the city of Geneva, famous for giving sanctuary to refugees, confers on the Charrua a dignity he does not appear to intend.</p>
<p>His use of the word “freedom,” which at the time of his writing was becoming a kind of shorthand for bourgeois revolutionary ambitions, does the same. Finally, as Verdesio argues, Lozano’s text (and Azara’s as well, though not the part quoted by Schelling) informs us of an objective fact: Members of diverse cultures and ethnic groups sought refuge among the Charrua, a culture that the authorities they were fleeing considered inferior to the European one. 33</p>
<p>In April 1831, while Schelling was in Munich working on his <em>Philosophy of Mythology</em>, the first president of Uraguay held a barbeque that he thought would attract the largest possible number of Charrua. 34 Once the guests had taken their fill of food and strong drink, a contingent of soldiers led by the president’s nephew began killing them. Women and children were enslaved. The few men who escaped were hunted down a few months later, again by the president’s nephew.</p>
<p>The <em>Criollo</em> ruling class, for whom the Charrua represented a failure to adapt to the requirements of a universal brotherhood, which had to include such supposedly universal needs as respect for private property, was silent about this massacre. Four surviving Charrua, including a shaman, a warrior, and a young couple, were captured and taken to Paris, where they were exhibited to the public and studied by naturalists. A child was born to the young couple. The three of them died a few years later. Until the 1990s, the response of intellectuals to these massacres, says Verdesio, was “silence and dissimulation.” 35</p>
<p>In “Interpretations of Black Religion in America,” Charles Long characterized the “American experience” as Otto’s <em>mysterium fascinosum</em> without the <em>mysterium tremendum</em>. 36 The Enlightenment’s “direct relationship to the sacred” through the forms of nature and moral conscience (theoretical and practical reason) was that through which “the destruction of the Indian cultures took place, and a nation which at its inception proclaimed the equality of all human beings was able to continue the institution of slavery.” 37</p>
<p>The “innocence and naivete of the American” emerges from self-concealment, and “is gained only through an intense suppression of the deeper and more subtle dimension of American experience.” Americans don’t have time to contemplate the depth of their deeds. They are always rushing forward. By means of this outward and forward gaze, Americans “are able to repress the profound and agonizing relationship which has defined their being in space and nature.” 38 In reference to Thomas JJ Altizer’s account of Moby Dick, Long, echoing his criticism of Tillich, says that this account “speaks of death as glibly as if he has never experienced, or is afraid to experience, the dying and the killing itself.” There is “no patience, no meditative attitude, no attentiveness” in this headlong rush into the future. Thus, this eschatology “is not rooted in that basic contact with reality which is the touchstone of every myth.” But there is another American experience,</p>
<blockquote><p>that has confronted the reality of America, not as a plastic and flexible reality, amenable to the human will through hard work and moral fortitude, but as a reality impenetrable, definite, subtle, a reality so agonizing that it forced the American to give up innocence while at the same time sustaining him as joy and promise. 39</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="wp-image-954 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Moby_Dick_p510_illustration-191x300.jpg" alt="moby_dick_p510_illustration" width="405" height="636" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Moby_Dick_p510_illustration-191x300.jpg 191w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Moby_Dick_p510_illustration-172x270.jpg 172w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Moby_Dick_p510_illustration.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" />This quality of experience “destroyed forever the naïve innocence, simultaneously revealing a God of both nature and time – a God” – quoting <em>Lift Every Voice and Sing</em> – “of our silent tears and a God of our weary years.” Long proposes an orientation “that might be able to affirm nature as a non-innocent reality and at the same time open up the possibility of a true historical future” that would emerge only after America comes to terms “with its own depth in reality” and begins to take “the integrity of nature seriously.”</p>
<p>Long’s orientation has much in common with Tillich’s, but it calls for turning our gaze toward a past that begins with a contact between Europeans and those who did not fit easily into their myths of origin. This past, like Dreaming Innocence, is absolute in the sense that it is obscured by the conventional story of the mighty deeds of great men but accompanies that story as its disavowed underside, and it holds the key to promise. This is why a historiography of “the true story of America” would not take the place of an “objective” reporting of facts, because this very mode of historiography repeats the tale of self-transparent Reason and the mighty deeds of Reasoned men. 40 Long suggests it belongs to the category of myth.</p>
<p>Tillich’s characterization of Dreaming Innocence does not appear to have a place in this orientation, because innocence itself has become a suspicious category, as it already was for Tillich. But the Charrua do have a place, and not only as a monstrous other signifying unrestrained dispersion and loss of center. They have a place as “the depth in reality” of the struggle against an authority and exploitation that poses as objective, free, and innocent. The Charrua do not fit well into the picture of Dreaming Innocence but their centuries of effective resistance to the men who do the mighty deeds does suggest that they can inspire such resistance now and can offer a vision of a kind of world where the demand for freedom that Europe purports to cherish can be met, though not on terms set by the Europeans. But in addition to reading the silences in the texts about them that testify to their agency, as Verdesio does, this would involve facing up to the irretrievable loss of innocence in all its horrific and paradoxical detail as the reality within which joy and promise can appear.</p>
<p>Not Dreaming Innocence but precisely the <em>mysterium tremendum</em>, the impenetrable reality that resists transparency, the agonizing, conflictual encounter with an actual otherness that resists and does not yield to any demand, becomes the source for imagining and actualizing a New World and a New Being, if we have the courage to face that reality.</p>

<p>As Tillich argues in the second dissertation, Kant views consciousness as “nothing but the act of synthesis of the manifold” – the structured uniting of a sensory multiplicity &#8211; by means of the “forms of comprehension” he calls the understanding. 1 Subjectivity is this unity, objectivity is this manifold, and truth is their identity. There is, however, no single perfect synthesis but rather “particular acts of the synthesizing consciousness.&#8221; 2</p>
<p>Consciousness must synthesize because it just is the act of synthesis, but its own particularity appears among the manifold it must synthesize. Consciousness must attend to its own position in space and time and to the irreducible blindness that comes along with that positionality, and this prompts Kant to introduce the “boundary concept of the “thing in itself.” The “thing in itself” is a boundary concept because it cannot be a part of the synthesis and cannot be said to cause either the phenomena of experience or the structuring synthesis that constructs and unifies them by means of the concepts of the understanding, since causality itself is among those concepts.</p>
<p>Tillich asserts that the “thing in itself” appears in the first Critique as what resists the rational, as the “irrational hypostasized” and the “focal point of all the irrational moments in the development of Idealism.” 3 It is against the “thing in itself” that the traditional proofs for the existence of God collide. Although the ontological proof can lead reason to the idea of an absolute essence, being in itself, it cannot establish the existence of such an essence.</p>
<p>The idea of the unconditioned is presupposed by the conditioned nature of everything in experience; our acts of synthesis order the phenomena of experience in a series of dependencies, but this series collapses without an unconditioned to ground it. 4 So we search in existence for that which “in its concept contains a therefore for every wherefore.” 5 We decide to take for granted an <em>ens realissimum</em>, a most real being, because our synthesizing activity demands it in order to risk the act of synthesis. If we go further, however, and think we have proven the existence of such a most real being, we forget that “the unconditioned necessity of judgments is not the same as the absolute necessity of things.” 6</p>
<p>As Tillich puts it, “there is no way that leads from there back to existence and to the conditioned, for the <em>via causalitatis </em>is blocked.” 7 Ontological and cosmological starting-points are ideas, not objects of experience, not existing things. Tillich says that Kant’s distinction between the idea of essence and actual existence “is one of the most consequential for the development of philosophy.”</p>
<p>For Tillich, Kant’s critique of the “intelligent design” argument “occupies a peculiar position” because it anticipates the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>’s analysis of the experience of natural beauty, which for Kant relies on reason’s attribution of purposiveness to nature. 8 The core of that argument’s elaboration in Kant’s third critique foregrounds aesthetic judgment that “looks toward the harmony of the universal rules of the understanding and the sensuous particular and finds in this identity the principle of beauty.” 9 But this argument forgets the sublime, experienced in “the overwhelming oppressive power of the object.” 10</p>
<p>This experience involves a “subjection of the senses” and a corresponding “feeling of repulsion,” followed by a feeling of pleasure as theoretical (mathematical sublime) or practical (dynamic sublime) reason works to overcome this subjection. But in spite of this last move, the experience of the sublime points to “a conflict between sensibility and reason” that resists the synthesis of natural purposiveness in the experience of organic beauty as purposiveness collides with the inorganic sublime. 11</p>
<p>Kant’s own attempt to provide a proof for the necessity of an idea of God rests finally on practical reason. Autonomy and freedom are the two maxims of practical reason, derived solely from reason itself. Freedom is “the independence of reason from material motives that lie outside of its self-determination,” so that its only law is the law of its own being. 12 Autonomy is freedom in the negative sense (e.g., the absence of constraint), and practical reason’s intrinsic legislation (the categorical imperative) is freedom in the positive sense, though it is nothing other than the expression of reason’s autonomy. But since “in every individual it is the nature of reason to be supra-individual,” rational beings can rationally decide to substitute their own individual autonomy for the legislation that derives from reason’s general autonomy.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-941 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-Exorcist-300x185.jpg" alt="the-exorcist" width="430" height="265" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-Exorcist-300x185.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-Exorcist-270x167.jpg 270w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-Exorcist.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" />This is radical evil, the opposition of freedom to itself, and as Tillich observes, Kant insists that “all men” have made this decision against reason. 13 The “sensible, material incentives of the will,” though indifferent in themselves, become sin when they “come into contradiction with reason and dissolve its identity.” In order to rescue freedom from the fracture that is the conflict between the rational being’s highest good (happiness) and the highest good demanded by the universal self-legislating power that makes of that being a conscious experiencer and actor (a grasper and a shaper), Kant posits God as a “subjective necessity.”</p>
<p>This necessity assures the acting subject that its obedience to reason’s categorical imperative will not have been a useless gesture even if it runs up against the causal chain of events in a way that results in the suffering and death of the happiness-seeking free being. God must be posited because God harmonizes the demands of reason with this causal chain in such a way as to lead eventually to the reconciliation of happiness and virtue. Thus, for Kant, God “remains an object in relation to the thinking subject, a thing, even though thinking and willing are ascribed to him,” and this posited God does not draw reason beyond itself so that the affirmation of this God “is without the force of truth.” 14 Autonomous reason “is certain only of itself, of its own autonomous legislation.”</p>
<p>What remained largely implicit in Kant was rendered explicit in Fichte, namely the unity of the free moral legislator and the transcendental unity of apperception as the conscious reason from which both freedom and nature derive. As Tillich argues, this is Schelling’s starting-point. The Kantian “’thing in itself,’ ‘radical evil,’ and ‘the inorganic’ (the sublime)” shatter the Kantian system as Schelling’s work develops. 15 These three instances of reason’s irrationality challenge the coherence of theoretical reason, practical reason, and judgment respectively, and point to a Real that resists reason, that cannot be posited by a rational free subject and cannot be escaped.</p>
<p>This Real, unlike the Kantian-Fichtean God, is simultaneously included in and excluded from its own ontology. Its referent is that which is known by its very contradictory appearance in the self-world structure to be other than idea, other than concept. It is the irrational in experience despite experience’s own reliance on a reasoning synthesis that pits theoretical and practical reason’s <em>a priori </em>assumptions against themselves and each other. Essence, known only through the traces the subject leaves in existence as it synthesizes and acts, as it grasps and shapes, cannot be found in existence and is continually disrupted by existence.</p>
<p>For Tillich, this disruption is as fatal to Kant’s God as it is constitutive of Schelling’s God and his own. Tillich’s “ground of being,” which is also an “unground” or abyss, is a repudiation of Kantian theology based on what it reveals about the failure to establish an identity that will successfully hold the elements of experience together in a coherent unity.</p>
<p>In the <em>Systematic Theology</em>, Tillich follows his own earlier analysis of Schelling’s work and identifies the resistance to free deciding subjectivity with the first person of the Trinity and with Schelling’s first potency. Tillich rejects the notion that God is <em>actus purus</em>, in Whom every potentiality is also actual. For Tillich, a God Who was pure actuality would be dead. God is living only inasmuch as God is both potentiality and actuality. Tillich cites both Bohme’s “nature in God” and Schelling’s “first potency” in defense of his notion that God is the dynamic tension between actuality and potentiality. 16</p>
<p>God’s dynamism is the source of divine creativity. As potentiality, it includes a “not yet” as well as an “already.” Tillich calls potentiality “the negative element in the ground of being which is overcome as negative in the process of being itself.” Thus, he says, God is no closer to consciousness than to the unconscious. God carries within Godself that in Godself which is not God. In human beings, this element is not overcome and remains “effective as a threat and a potential disruption.” 17 This element is opposed to form, again following Tillich’s own understanding of Schelling. Tillich refuses to subordinate God’s will to God’s reason.</p>
<p>For Tillich, this means that God’s dynamic, creative, but ultimately blind self-transcendence is not subordinated to its expression in structure, reason, and form. Tillich argues that for over a century, “a decision has been made in favor of the dynamic element.” Tillich thinks this decision agrees more with the Bible, where God’s freedom encompasses what appear as surprising and arbitrary events, than does Kant’s. This dynamic element is God’s <em>aseity</em>, God’s self-derivation, but self-derivation also implies unconditionedness, irresistible, resisting, up-againstness. “A conditioned God is no God.” 18 But as reflection on this concept shows, God’s freedom runs up against itself with questions like whether God could choose to be free or whether his freedom is his destiny.</p>
<p>Tillich’s answer seems to be “yes,” since here he shifts from an ontological to an epistemological perspective, saying that humanity’s ultimate concern does not depend on humanity or on any other finite being or concern. The term used throughout the rest of the <em>Systematic Theology </em>to refer to this self-transcending dynamism that resists actuality, strangely since it is associated with dynamism and potentiality rather than with act, is “power.”</p>
<p>As Clayton Crockett argues in his <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5oVuJrADJ58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Interstices of the Sublime</a>, </em>19 Tillich’s interpretation of Schelling’s <em>Weltalter </em>correctly reads Schelling as saying that the first potency is the creative power of God, and not simply, as Slavoj Zizek would read it, God’s self-enclosure. Self-enclosure is an entailment of self-transcendence, an entailment that correlates with the form or structure that becomes actual in self-transcendence. As creativity generates form, creativity resists final form, and this dynamism is precisely what we are up against when we are up against up-againstness.</p>
<p>God’s self-enclosure is an image of this secondary up-againstness of the first potency in Schelling and the First Person in Tillich. The Second Person, described as “meaning and structure,” is the eternal expression of the first. The Second Person is experienced as reality’s quasi-stability. Without it, the First Person “would be chaos, burning fire,” not creative ground. It would also be “absolute seclusion,” Luther’s “naked absolute,” and demonic. The Spirit is the force that unites ground with meaning, power with structure, the First Person with the Second.</p>
<p>As potentiality that is actual only in anticipation, Dreaming Innocence, like Holy Spirit, is located in the tension between dynamism and form, in potentiality emerging in one of nature’s processes and poised to act, tempted to act, but not expressing its own finite potentiality in a definite act. The state to which is points not only cannot be found in nature inasmuch as nature itself is already subject to the tragic, conflictual result of the separation of potentiality and actuality, but is finally found in a divine reality itself in eternal, almost unbearable, tension. A strange dream indeed, and an even stranger innocence.</p>
<p><em>Dreaming Innocence in Political Expectation: the Socialist Decision </em></p>
<p>This understanding of the Trinity, grounded as it is in Tillich’s close reading of German idealist philosophy, underlies Tillich’s arguments in <em>The Socialist Decision </em>about the myth of origin, the bourgeois principle, and the socialist principle. In the introduction to the book that was to play a momentous role in his life, the German Tillich argues that any discussion of politics must begin with humanity’s dual nature. In this book, Tillich argues that humanity is a life-process that questions itself and its environment and thus is not one with itself. Human self-consciousness makes humans “internally dualized” as nature is not.</p>
<p>Political theory must proceed from the conditions in which political thought is rooted, and not be derived</p>

<p>“from purely mental processes.” 20 It must take account of “drives and interests,” of “pressures and aspirations.” In this political work, Tillich is invoking what appears as the dynamic up-againstness of the <em>Systematic Theology</em>, and as the “first potency” in the two dissertations on Schelling. Moreover, he argues, political theory must also take account of the fact that even “the most primitive emotional drive is shaped by consciousness.” 21 Here Tillich is invoking the meaning and structure discussed in the <em>Systematic Theology</em>, and the “second potency” of Schelling. Humanity “arises out of being and at the same time determines it.” Human thrownness (Tillich cites Heidegger explicitly on this) implies the human question of “whence?” This question is addressed primordially in myth &#8211; the only kind of myth, since every myth is a myth of origin. 22</p>
<p>Human beings experience themselves as “posited” before they experience themselves as positing. The origin is creative. The myth of origin tells us how it is that reality “brings us forth as something new and singular, but it takes us, as such, back to the origin again.” The dimension of experience that corresponds to the myth of origin is for Tillich “the root of all conservative and romantic thought in politics.” But human beings also experience themselves “in existence,” which for them includes the experience of “a demand that frees them from being simply bound to what is given, and which compels them to add to the question ‘whence?’ the question ‘whither?’” 23</p>
<p>The demand is a demand “for something that does not yet exist but should exist.” The being who experiences the demand knows that it involves “more than a mere development of what already is” and is “directed toward what ought to be.” Therefore, “the question ‘whither’ is not contained within the limits of the question ‘whence?’ It is something unconditionally new that transcends what is new and what is old within the sphere of mere development.”</p>
<p>The unconditional demand “that something unconditionally new should be realized through oneself” breaks the myth of origin. This “is the root of liberal, democratic, and socialist thought in politics.” 24 If the break with the myth of origin marks the difference between conservative, romantic thought and liberal thought, the break with metaphysical harmony marks the difference between liberal bourgeois thought and the socialist principle. Liberal bourgeois thought “believes in a metaphysical harmony which is certain to prevail in the historical process,” and is confident that “nature is knowable and can be put into the service of humanity because the categories of the human mind are the elements that give nature its structure.” 25</p>
<p>The bourgeois revolution of 1848 “attempted to free all strata of society from the bonds of origin, both spiritually and materially, by raising the idea of progress to the status of an ontological and ethical principle.” The bourgeois principle relied on the belief in harmony and progress, so that “if the belief in harmony is shaken, the bourgeois principle is shaken.” And it has been shaken. Tillich’s earlier analysis of Kant in the second dissertation had already recounted its philosophical unraveling, and his interpretations of Fall, Creation, and Divine self-transcendence emerge from that unraveling. Here he discusses its social unraveling. Not only is it the case that “the bourgeois belief in harmony and in progress stands in total contradiction to the proletarian situation,” 26 but even the bourgeoisie and the proletariat must forge alliances with the powers of origin in order to win elections.</p>
<p>Moreover, socialist neglect of the powers of origin is naïve, since it must oppose the bourgeois principle but has nothing in itself from which to forge a positive vision of the future. Its demand is the demand for the new that fuels the bourgeois principle, but it lacks the latter’s belief in harmony, the belief that lends to it the conviction that its actions are in accord with nature or its God. It has an ontology of conflict and an ethics of hope, and these are in conflict. But Tillich notes that this is only apparently true, because inasmuch as socialism emerges from the historically and socially located struggle of the proletariat, it is rooted in a cultural past, in a particular myth of origin, which is the Christian myth. It is a myth of humanity breaking with the origin in response to the demand, and of reconciliation through the actualization of the demand in a way that is transparent to the power of origin – theonomous justice.</p>
<p>In Tillich’s retelling of the Adam myth in <em>The Socialist Decision</em>, Dreaming Innocence belongs to the powers of origin, to the conservative, romantic politics of National Socialism. But Tillich warns against a simple rejection of the powers of origin and the state of Dreaming Innocence, or essence.</p>
<p>Socialism, if it is to actualize its own vision of justice, must do so from out of the givenness of its situation and the imaginable possibilities accessible to it in that realm. It has the advantage of rejecting bourgeois harmony and recognizing the tension that characterizes existence. It must also recognize the givenness that empowers its effort to actualize the demand. In the concept of the <em>kairos</em>, Tillich seeks to preserve both political expectation as eternal unactualized potentiality and as expectation for specific concrete radical change in a given situation, “a definite content of expectation” emerging from and pertinent to “a particular time.” 27</p>
<p>In the fourth and final lecture of Tillich’s 1951 series on the political meaning of utopia, 28 delivered half a decade after his declaration that the time of <em>kairos </em>had passed us by, Tillich stands by his earlier assessment of the <em>kairos </em>concept by way of a kind of political autobiography. He begins with the return from World War I to a German homeland where a conservative Lutheran transcendental utopia was in conflict with utopian socialism, an immanental utopia. “Socialism had won the revolution because the forces of the conservatives had been disorganized or destroyed by the War.” 29 Lutheranism, the “Protestant majority,” adopted a negative stance toward any social utopia.</p>
<p>Tillich and other colleagues’ wartime experiences and reflections convinced them that “a utopia of simply going forward did not grasp the human situation in its finitude and estrangement” and that an exclusively transcendent utopia “cannot be an expression of the New Being.” They decided that “in the horizontal dimension something can happen, something new, something realizable here and now, under present circumstances and conditions, with the possibilities given to us” and that “we must go forward in order to see these possibilities and convert them into reality.” 30 They discerned in the actual situation “an ‘hour of fulfillment’ of possibilities which earlier could not come to fulfillment.” They opposed to this perception of an hour of fulfillment a Lutheran transcendental theology which declared this utopic action to be “a preliminary and consequently ambiguous one” that “we did not dare” affirm as absolute.</p>
<p>After this, says Tillich, came “terror, and fanaticism turned against itself.” This reaffirmed the sense that actualized utopia in existence “remains provisional and ambiguous.” They were told that the <em>kairos </em>concept would “weaken the revolutionary forces” because it could not “demand an unconditional faith.” Indeed, says Tillich, their critics had a point. Basic social insecurity increases human beings’ desire to “surrender themselves totally to a finite reality.” 31 Forces “aroused” in this way “dare not be underestimated” and “are indeed great forces,” leading to the necessity of “an unconditional commitment against them.” This unconditional commitment must be coupled, however, with the knowledge that “we are not committed to something absolute but to something provisional and ambiguous” that is subject to criticism and even to rejection, but that at the moment calls for an unambiguous “Yes.”</p>
<p>Without this reserve, this contracting movement of withdrawal from the actual that makes every concrete utopian struggle appear as fragmentary and anticipatory, the utopian self-transcendence that can be or is being actualized in the <em>kairos </em>of the current context “collides with our own finite nature and shatters.” But with it, with the acknowledgement of the fragmentary and anticipatory nature of finite utopia grounded in the potentiality that is never wholly and finally actualized, “the truth of utopia is on our side and this truth will eventually triumph.” Despite being “rebuked repeatedly” for holding on to “this principle of ultimate criticism,” Tillich ends his autobiographical sketch by declaring that “history has proved us right.”</p>
<p>In these lectures, Tillich makes the relationship between the Dreaming Innocence myth and the demand that breaks it and that fuels movements against authority (bourgeois revolution) and exploitation (proletarian revolution) clearer than it is in the <em>Systematic Theology</em>. In the first lecture, he develops his political ontology starting from “man’s essence” and “the ground of being insofar as it reveals itself to man.” 32 As in the <em>Systematic Theology</em>, freedom means that a human being is “able to act as a whole person, as a self in the wholeness of his being” rather than as the vehicle of conflicting drives. 33 Freedom also means “having possibilities.” This is the case because human beings are “able to transcend the given, and infinitely to transcend it.”</p>
<p>Of course, this is not true “in fact,” and that is “the problem of finitude.” Unfreedom is dehumanizing primarily because the loss of selfhood, the loss of the unity of the person, results. “He who no longer is able to act from centeredness, from wholeness, whence all elements of his being join in an ultimate decision, has ceased to be man in the true sense of the word.” It is the loss of centeredness and not the loss of possibility that is primary and most tragic in unfreedom. The “I” becomes an object to others and to itself, “incapable of reacting in a centered way.” 34 Moreover, possibility is temptation: power corrupts because power means “having possibility in a concrete, practical sense.” If possibility “ontologically constitutes” the structure of humanity, this becomes “concrete possibility” in an organization or group that has power – giving politics its dignity and its temptations.</p>
<p>Humanity’s finitude means that the actualization of its possibility always threatens it with nonbeing. This threat is not simply a matter of external threats such as violence and death, but also a matter of internal threats such as “error and guilt.” Every transcendence of the given is subject to the loss of self in error and guilt. Thus, human beings are essentially anxious and courage is the taking of that anxiety upon oneself rather than denying or overlooking it.</p>
<p>Since anxiety is ontological rather than simply psychological, it cannot be escaped. Under conditions of <img class=" wp-image-943 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/anxiety-300x230.jpg" alt="anxiety" width="496" height="380" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/anxiety-300x230.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/anxiety-270x207.jpg 270w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/anxiety.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" />existence, it generates a “will to security” that “seeks always to safeguard against future threats by becoming all the more attached to the past.” 35 Tillich mentions that at “this” time (1951), this was becoming true in America. Americans were “choosing (the past) rather than the present or the future” because they believed they would find in that past unthreatened security where so much has survived for so long. 36 This statement is interesting in view of the way Dreaming Innocence functions in the <em>Systematic Theology </em>as a kind of absolute past eternally accompanying existence.</p>
<p>Tillich is here accusing Americans of seeking a return to Dreaming Innocence that, while manifesting the form of courage that self-protection is, loses “the dimension of the future.” Another side of anxiety attaches itself to expectation. Unlike security, expectation “looks to the fulfillment in the future of those possibilities which indeed constitute the essence” of humanity. Expectation, like security, looks to an absolute past of pure potentiality, but recomposes the elements of this past as partial and anticipatory fulfillment of that very non-actualized past. It “goes forward beyond the given, toward the future.” It has a double anxiety: anxiety about giving up security and anxiety about giving up the unrealized possibilities that this security stifles.</p>
<p>It is at this point in the lecture that Tillich explicitly introduces what he calls “the psychology of innocence.” Innocence, he says, is this expectation. It is anxious about losing possibilities and about and anxious about losing security. Innocence “stands between these two anxieties and in this situation of anxiety, it has to make a decision.” But when it does so, it can’t win for losing, and what it loses is precisely innocence, “even if it decides for non-actualization.” If Adam had decided to leave that fruit alone, he would still have fallen because “immediacy is in any case lost as the result of conscious decision.” This anxiety of expectation is what dreaming innocence looks like close-up in actual experience.</p>
<p>This is why every futurally oriented utopian project, according to Tillich, looks to a prelapsarian past as fuel for a utopia that is nevertheless imagined as other than that past, as its fulfillment. 37 Utopia is not just in the future but first of all “once upon a time.” The “will to security” seeks “that which points to the future” among what is given as “having already been present in the past” and is thus accessible now as “essence.” Here, Tillich cites fellow Schellingian socialist Ernst Bloch, whose writing on hope influenced liberation theologian Gustavo Guttierez, in support of his claim that “dreams of a better life – are primarily dreams that look in the first instance to the past but then also to the future.” By looking to the past, warrant for the dreaming is “derived from the fact that the content of these dreams was once reality.”</p>
<p>Tillich draws several examples from mythology and politics in which a time of origin renders plausible a better life in the future. In each of them, a primordial essence before the origin is lost and we now live in contradiction to it, but it can be restored. “The ontological distinction between essence and existence, essence and actuality, is here projected into the dimension of time.” 38 In myths of origin and expectation, we always live in the worst of times. “It is always the last period that gives birth to utopia.” This is what makes the moment of reversal immanent. 39</p>
<p>Tillich castigates both existentialism and Karl Barth for abandoning the structure of expectation and the anxiety of Dreaming Innocence, the former by denying that humanity has an essence and the latter by declaring humanity to be too utterly estranged to participate in it. Barth, like Augustine, abandons expectation to the resignation that “the last age no longer lies before us” but against them Tillich poses “an unbroken movement of groups that believe there is a dialectic that makes the great reversal inevitable once the deepest No has been reached.” 40</p>
<p>In the third lecture, Tillich declares that utopia etymologically suggests “that for which there is not yet or is no longer a place in reality, which can nowhere be found even if one goes to the remotest islands.” 41 It is “that which comes out of the past as recollection and is an anticipation of what may come in the future.” 42 Its principle is “the negation of the negative,” of finitude and estrangement. Finitude and estrangement, however, are ubiquitous. This is why an imagined social utopia that isolates social utopia from nature and then expects “something within the human sphere that can be meaningful only if it is expected in unity with a universal healing” is the most unrealistic of all utopias, far more unrealistic than the frankly unrealistic Biblical vision of the lion lying down with the lamb. Since humanity is within nature, conflict in humanity is not ended as long as conflict in nature remains; conflict is natural as well as social and cannot be realistically transcended except in anticipatory and partial actualizations. 43</p>
<p>Power dynamics, likewise, cannot be escaped and “cannot be bad.” Utopia does not oppose these but rather opposes “the ruling structure” that is “actual as an estranged ruling structure” now in our present circumstances. This structure “has two sides,” authority and exploitation. Opposition to these occurs “through the whole of history” but culminates in the post-Enlightenment bourgeois revolutions founded on the immediate participation of rational beings in Reason. Tillich then repeats his criticism of the bourgeois assumption of harmony, though more gently than in <em>The Socialist Decision</em>. The fourth lecture discusses the positive meaning of utopia (truth, fruitfulness, and power) and its negative meaning (untruth, unfruitfulness, and impotence), and suggests the <em>kairos </em>as a concept that is grounded in self-transcendence: “only where life risks itself, stakes itself, and imperils itself in going as far as possible beyond itself” can life be found. What is not yet “lies still beyond the decision of whether it is possible or impossible” and because of this, Tillich suggests, an absolute unrealizable utopia – a potentiality that is in principle never realized, a messianic age that never comes – and a relative, immanent, and realizable partial and fragmentary actualization of it are necessary.</p>
<p>Dreaming Innocence here returns as what always accompanies and serves as a critical negation of every actual utopian project. Dreaming Innocence – potentiality that is never actualized, the absolute past – is both that from which we are separated by the decision to actualize the demand for self-transcendence, and that from which, from within existence, the demand itself comes to us. “Humanity before the Fall,” a repetition of the First Person of the Trinity, the state of ontological (as opposed to psychological or existential, e.g., estranged) anxiety, is repeated in the kairotic risk that, partially and fragmentarily, actualizes the New Being in social movements here and now and that provides the material for critical evaluation and transcendence of those movements.</p>
<p>The desire to return to Dreaming Innocence by preserving the given as a means of obtaining security fuels romantic reactionary politics, while the critical “use” of Dreaming Innocence, which couples it with rejection of the given, a decision to risk something new, fuels a revolutionary “utopian” politics that is perpetual, taking as it does its Dreaming Innocence with it even as it rejects the given. Revolutionary politics, the overthrowing of estranged authority and exploitation, looks back toward Dreaming Innocence but leans into the demand that promises an actual future beyond authority and exploitation, but also beyond innocence and beyond dreaming.</p>

<p>One of the challenges of liberation theology is to think the radical political and social liberation of the oppressed in a way that is truly this-worldly. This challenge is already clearly apparent in Gustavo Gutierrez’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_65XWzMCx8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+theology+of+liberation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKoaST94_QAhVizFQKHbn6CwMQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20theology%20of%20liberation&amp;f=false"><em>A Theology of Liberation </em></a>in 1972, which insists on starting from “facts and questions derived from the world” in order “to be part of a process through which the world is transformed.” 1 In the tension between being fully in the world and radically refusing the system of oppression and exploitation that not only troubles the word but in every meaningful sense <em>is </em>the world as it is, liberation theology reclaims the tension of the early Jesus movement’s focus on the eschatological “kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>Liberation theology has largely sought to contribute to this as a “critical reflection” not entirely from within it, but by juxtaposing it to “the Word accepted in faith.” 2 Although liberation theologians do not interpret the Word in the crude sense of a kind of Biblicism or fundamentalism, they do look to criteria (for instance, Boff’s “brotherhood, justice, liberation, and goodness”), 3 that are ‘intuited’ to point to ways that existing conditions contradict “the divine plan”. 4</p>
<p>The Word itself for what can now be regarded as “classical” liberation theology is received within the hermeneutical circle, as Segundo outlines it in the first chapter of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=stlKAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+liberation+of+theology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd69av94_QAhXpqFQKHcBUB_kQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20liberation%20of%20theology&amp;f=false"><em>The Liberation of Theology</em></a>. 5 Within this circle, the Biblical text occupies one pole of a bipolar process with four stages. These two poles are (1) profound and enriching questions and suspicions about current reality and (2) profound and enriching interpretations of the Bible. 6 The second pole is linked to though not exhausted by a certain static element, linked to divine revelation.</p>
<p>Segundo’s sophisticated and incisive analysis in this book surrounds that static element with a dynamism on all sides, since acceptance of the revelatory quality of what Sorbino calls “the deposit of faith” depends on a prior commitment, or option, made in the midst of a life that, echoing Kierkegaard by way of Camus, can only be lived forward and cannot be seen from an objective, transhistorical perspective. This commitment precedes and motivates the reception of revelatory content itself, and this revelatory content, once accepted, continues to be interpreted in light of the option that is being lived by the indivdiual or community doing the interpretation.</p>
<p>Segundo’s supercessionist but anti-Marcionite interpretation of the Hebrew Bible leads him to extend the circle, not just to Biblical interpretation, but to the Biblical witness itself. 7 Nevertheless, in Segundo’s account and “classical” liberation theology in general, revelatory content or “transcendent data” are contained in the witness as a whole: “transcendent data offered by God penetrate into the corresponding questions that arise within the whole of human experience.” 8</p>
<p>Paul Tillich’s theological circle has a similar static pole, ultimately the Bible as the original testimony to the event of Jesus as the Christ, 9 though in Tillich, this is qualified because the church is the source of that Biblical witness and not the other way around, 10 and the church itself is situated within a broader revelatory context that includes the history of religion and culture as a whole. 11 This latter context, which Tillich took up with enthusiasma at different points in his life and to which his dialogue with Buddhism represents a return toward the end of his life, was left uncompleted by him.</p>
<p>This article argues that Tillich’s concept of “Dreaming Innocence” as a poetic expression of the reality to which the Biblical myth of pre-lapsarian paradise points reflects a lingering nostalgia for just the kind of transcendent data that would be unsullied by the world and its conflicts and provide a criterion for liberatory theory and praxis when joined with concrete historical forms of oppression and exploitation. Nevertheless, Tillich’s development of this concept in the context of his theological work darkens Dreaming Innocence to such a degree that it raises questions about the appropriateness of any transcendent datum whatsoever beyond the ontological self-transcendence that, for him, is as ultimately real as it gets.</p>
<p>The image of a prelapsarian “innocence” becomes a rhetorical device that anchors political and</p>

<p>cultural practice to what is ultimately a Western colonialist norm that he explicitly rejects. Tillich’s development of the concept of Dreaming Innocence can inform emancipatory practice, but only if we allow the other side of the Western colonial experience to critically address not only the interpretation of Western religion and culture, but Western religion and culture itself.</p>
<p>Whatever else it may be, Paul Tillich’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fNYnAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=tillich+systematic+theology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSyr7K94_QAhWqwlQKHcfIDXMQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tillich%20systematic%20theology&amp;f=false"><em>Systematic Theology </em></a>is a quintessentially and paradoxically American text. It is especially so in its treatment of the transition from essence to existence, and the Dreaming Innocence that “precedes” that transition. It is so both directly – Tillich considered it his ‘gift’ to his adopted country – and indirectly, rooted as it is in Schelling’s work during the first half of the nineteenth century, and the latter’s incorporation of Enlightenment period American contact narratives into his myth of the Fall. Tillich’s development of the concept of Dreaming Innocence as a myth with an ambiguous allure causes it to function critically against both conservative and revolutionary politics.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the preservation of a notion of innocence against the background of a conflictual reality composed of bipolar forces in tension, a background that all the way into Tillich’s presentation of divinity, places Tillich within a theological legacy that itself evades and recoils from the de-centering power of the kind of origin that America represents and that its tales of itself conceal. I suggest that this de-centering power, rather than Dreaming Innocence, is the appropriate starting-point for an American myth of origin that articulates the demand of the empirical others expelled and exploited by the Dreaming Innocence that fuels American utopian efforts.</p>
<p>The <em>Systematic Theology </em>is quintessentially American because it does not simply repeat or translate the body of work that Tillich had already undertaken in a different language and a different place. Tillich’s American work is re-orientation and a departure. There are two very important differences between Tillich’s German (1910-1930) and American (1945-1964) literary output that can illustrate this. First, the German output was deeply and often explicitly engaged with the <em>Identitätsphilosophie </em>that sustained his scholarly focus through two dissertations on Schelling (1910 and 1912) and a post-doctoral work that was almost rejected because it assumed the principles of <em>Identitätsphilosophie </em>rather than questioning or contextualizing them historically. 12</p>
<p>While his American output continues to draw heavily on this tradition, it is less concerned with the detailed analysis of philosophical texts in that tradition that, in the German period, helped fuel the genesis of his own “system.” His American students who, as Tillich later observed, “have the feeling that they start something new,” preferred to wonder at his originality than to engage the texts that incited his own wonder, and he accommodated them while patiently attempting to draw those he could to these earlier thinkers. 13</p>
<p>His books of sermons so expertly hid their philosophical underpinnings from the reader that Henry Sloane Coffin, on whose professional assistance Tillich relied after his arrival in America but who had made plain his aversion to philosophy in general and Schelling in particular, praised the “Christian quality.&#8221; 14</p>
<p>Second, after the First World War, the German output was explicitly engaged in politics. The American output, on the other hand, shied away from any overtly political theology. This output, it should be noted, is concentrated in the period after the War. When Tillich first arrived at Union in 1933, he was starting almost from scratch, with no savings, an insecure and precariously funded teaching position, and very little English. From then until 1948, he was involved in anti-Nazi German language radio broadcasts, refugee resettlement and assistance, and an outspoken antifascist and socialist among German refugee friends and acquaintances. It is fair to say that his focus in those years was on antifascist activity.</p>
<p>At the same time, his intense consciousness of his own émigré status, manifesting at times on an insistence that he was being watched, 15 caused him to shun political parties himself or any mass movement that might cast him as a foreign threat and to advise other émigrés to do the same. 16 His lack of familiarity with the American political scene and Coffin’s advise to stay clear of it caused him to tread much more carefully. Finally, in 1945, Tillich’s service as chair of the centrist, but contentious, Council for a Democratic Germany got him blacklisted by the U.S. Army. In 1948 he wrote about a “sacred void” and about the loss of the time of the <em>kairos</em>, a key concept in his political theology.</p>
<p>It is paradoxically American because, more than any of his other American work, it showcases a continuity with his earlier German work. Indeed, an attentive reading of Tillich’s dissertations on Schelling indicate that the major themes of the <em>Systematic Theology</em>, including static and dynamic polarities, the forces making up the Trinity, the dark ground of being, and the interpretations of myth and revelation, are already articulated there in his Schelling scholarship. Many of these concepts are also at work in his political essays and in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7W5NAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR31&amp;dq=The+Socialist+Decision&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz-u_o94_QAhWFr1QKHdQ4B0oQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>The Socialist Decision</em></a>, which are motivated by a political struggle in solidarity with the workers’ revolutionary struggle and against political romanticism.</p>
<p>In these works, Tillich focuses on a polarity between political romanticism founded on a myth of origin and bourgeois liberalism founded on eschatology, rationalization, and autonomy. Reading the <em>ST</em> through these earlier dissertations illuminates what is at stake politically and philosophically in the former so that the <em>ST</em>, though American, becomes a decidedly German text. At the same time, the ease that Tillich had acquired in relating complex philosophical concepts to experiences with which his pragmatic American readers could connect means that reading the dissertations through the <em>ST</em> also increases their accessibility to readers who, as he said of his students by way of contrasting them with their German counterparts, “feel that they start something new.” This should not be surprising, since Tillich began work on the ST in Germany early in his career.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-906 alignleft" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Nation_of_Islam__public_domain_-300x179.jpg" alt="nation_of_islam__public_domain_" width="432" height="258" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Nation_of_Islam__public_domain_-300x179.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Nation_of_Islam__public_domain_-270x161.jpg 270w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Nation_of_Islam__public_domain_.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" />Nevertheless, the <em>ST</em> alienated American theological colleagues as the sermons did not, partly because of its account of the doctrines of creation and fall. Reinhold Niebuhr became the first of many to criticize Tillich’s identification of creation and fall, which he argued ontologized the historical and robbed it of moral significance. 17 Coffin, after praising Tillich’s sermons, expressed dismay at the first volume of the ST because he thought it confirmed his worst fears about Tillich, that he was not a Christian but a philosophical mystic. 18</p>
<p>Tillich’s account of the Fall, his account of the state of Adam before the Fall as “dreaming innocence,” and his ontology of self-separation and unity-in-difference through the free renunciation of selfhood, not only point back both to the political and philosophical concerns of his German period but also, through his appropriation of Schelling’s philosophical approach to myth, to a trajectory that links him to a record of a sustained encounter in the late 18th century between the Enlightenment naturalist and soldier Felix de Azara and “wild” inhabitants of the Rio de la Plata in which the question of the universality of religion exposed Schelling and, through him, Tillich and ourselves to a certain shock and a certain task and promise beyond nostalgia for dreaming innocence or of a liberation in the self-transparency of the crucified self.</p>
<p>For Tillich, the Garden of Eden story points to a state that he calls “dreaming innocence.” Dreaming Innocence is not a natural state but rather essential being. Tillich says that not even nature is innocent. 19 Dreaming Innocence is not located in space and time at all, since everything in space and time is subject to the categories, which are the conditions of existence and thus already separated from essence, or potentiality. Because of this, Tillich declares that “there is a point in which creation and Fall coincide.”</p>
<p>This point is “creaturely freedom.” “Creaturely freedom” belongs to all creatures inasmuch as they are creatures, inasmuch as they are both “rooted in the creative ground” and actualizing themselves “through freedom” in relationship to that ground. 20 The fulfillment of creaturely freedom is “a break between existence and essence,” a “separation from the creative ground.”</p>
<p>This break is not just what separates nature from culture, but also what divides nature from its own ground, its own essence. There is no absolute discontinuity between “animal bondage” and “human freedom” so that “it is impossible to say” a nature “qualitatively different from animal nature” emerged from nature. 21 “The element of destiny” in nature, the unconscious “in its determining power,” “bodily and psychic strivings” are active in “what appears as conscious reason in a centered decision.” Sociality and ideology are also “effective in every individual decision” as “the universe works through us.”</p>
<p>So is undisturbed union with the ground of being, then, the location of Dreaming Innocence? It would not seem so, since this break between essence and existence “it is itself an expression of the polarity between “freedom and destiny <em>in </em>the ground of being.” It would be more appropriate, then, to characterize Dreaming Innocence as a <em>disturbed </em>union rather an undisturbed one. The Fall is a repetition of creation, which is itself a repetition and radicalization of the relationship between the first two persons of the Trinity, God as “inexhaustible ground” and “power of being,” in tension with God as “meaning and structure,” which Tillich affirms as “God’s self-objectification,” 22 and this, moreover, repeats the aforementioned tension within the ground of being itself.</p>
<p>Dreaming Innocence is a state of pure potentiality. Although in volume I of the ST, Tillich says that the state of the human before the fall “transcends potentiality and actuality” 23 but in volume II, he seems to withdraw this suggestion, saying instead that it “has potentiality, not actuality.”24 But this is not a simple withdrawal. Although Dreaming Innocence has “no place” and “no time,” it is “dreaming” inasmuch as it is “real and non-real at the same time” and inasmuch as it “anticipates the actual.” Dreaming looks forward to waking life, and in this way Dreaming Innocence includes the actual by way of anticipation.</p>
<p>So much for the dreaming, but what is at stake in the innocence? Tillich answers that Dreaming Innocence is “innocent” inasmuch as it lacks the <em>experience</em>, <em>responsibility</em>, and <em>guilt </em>that every actual event entails but nevertheless has them before it as a possibility. So this state is that pure potentiality anticipating the actual, but lacking experience, responsibility, and guilt. But Tillich, an avid reader of Freud, knew that the dreaming state is not directly accessible to the waking state and only appears there in a fragmented, distorted way.</p>
<p>So he says that Dreaming Innocence can appear to us “only in existential distortion.” 25 Nothing in existence, nothing that stands out against a background, is in a state of dreaming innocence, not even newborn infants, trees, or rocks. “’Adam before the Fall’ and ‘nature before the curse’ are states of potentiality. They are not actual states.” 26 So the reality of Dreaming Innocence is a problematic reality. Tillich does not reduce the real to the actual (see below), but imagining a real state without actuality, even one that is unreal at the same time, is to say the least to take on a formidable task.</p>
<p>Dreaming Innocence, then, is not a past state of actual human beings or a past state of any being. It is the memory of an absolute past that never was, but which it is necessary to imagine in order to make sense of the gap that divides self and world and self and self. Dreaming Innocence lacks actuality, experience, responsibility, and guilt, but what does it <em>have </em>that would make it play a part in the concerns of an existing human being or community? Tillich tell us that Dreaming Innocence is “an image of the state of essential being in which the motifs (the polarities driving to the transition from essence to existence, potentiality to actuality) are working.” 27 It is “a stage of infancy before contest and decision.”</p>
<p>Here, what it seems to offer is a vision of peace, in which the polarities that make up existence are not in conflict with each other. Nevertheless, this “stage of infancy,” this working together of the motifs, must go because “the goodness of man’s created nature” itself is just the possibility “and <em>necessity</em>” (italics mine) of actualizing what he is “in spite of the estrangement unavoidably connected“ with this move. Thus, “the state of dreaming innocence drives beyond itself.” Thus,</p>
<p>Dreaming Innocence or “mere potentiality” is not perfection, the latter being rather a “conscious union of existence and essence.” So the peace that Dreaming Innocence seems to offer is a strange kind of peace, a dissatisfied, restless peace that moves inexorably (the “necessity” of actualization in humanity’s created goodness) toward what will have destroyed it. Experience, responsibility and guilt come with decision, and the potentiality that Dreaming Innocence <em>is </em>is a potentiality for decision, or anxiety.</p>
<p>In the <em>ST</em> Tillich refers to Kierkegaard’s <em>Concept of Anxiety</em>, itself visibly influenced by Schelling’s account of anxiety in God, 28 to talk about what within dreaming innocence already drives toward its loss. Anxiety is nonbeing experienced “from the inside.” 29 Anxiety “belongs to the created character of being quite apart from estrangement and sin,” and “it is actual in ‘Adam’ (i.e., man’s essential nature) as well as in ‘Christ’ (i.e., man’s new reality).” 30</p>
<p>Despite the considerable tendency toward separation that anxiety represents and the absence of a</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-907 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4f605a6b840e52959cb1b8a51e863bf5-241x300.jpg" alt="opname/scan 2001" width="392" height="488" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4f605a6b840e52959cb1b8a51e863bf5-241x300.jpg 241w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4f605a6b840e52959cb1b8a51e863bf5-768x955.jpg 768w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4f605a6b840e52959cb1b8a51e863bf5-823x1024.jpg 823w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4f605a6b840e52959cb1b8a51e863bf5-217x270.jpg 217w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" />clear line that would separate necessity from decision, “an act in which all the drives and influences which constitute the destiny of man are brought into the centered unity” is still possible. This act is freedom. 31 Where the possibility of such an act appears, guilt is also possible and thus innocence. Since nature cannot perform such an act except in humanity, only humanity of all nature can be said to “have been” innocent.</p>
<p>Innocence is the recounted dream of the guilty existing – awakened &#8211; human being. “There was no utopia in the past, just as there will be no ‘utopia’ in the future. Actualized creation and estranged existence are identical.” Nevertheless, Tillich adds in explicit reply to Niebuhr, “the point of coincidence of creation and the Fall” is “not a logical coincidence.” 32</p>
<p>The transition to existence and actuality is not entailed in essence and potentiality, despite the “necessity” of humanity to realize the potential to act that is part of its created goodness; thus universally and for each conscious actor, the transition is “a leap” and not “a structural necessity.” The “leap” character, for Tillich, expresses his conviction – again, echoing Schelling &#8211; that one cannot start with an analysis of being and derive existence from it.</p>
<p>One can imagine an eternal tension between polarity of essence and existence, of potentiality and actuality – ultimately, as we have seen, in God or Reality itself and not just in humanity &#8211; that is never resolved into one or the other. To imagine this, however, is to imagine nothing, not to imagine a more perfect world. But the recounted dream of innocence and the guilty existent are not explanations for something more primordial: they are “the original fact.” 33</p>
<p>The point of coincidence between creation and Fall is the free decision for actual existence, which entails a cut in potentiality. It presupposes a bipolar unity of consciousness and what is not conscious in the divine itself, so that God’s self-expression is both as the expression of an unconditioned, inexpressible ground of being and an “indivisible remainder” or fracture within the structure of being that is the expressed itself.</p>
<p>For Tillich, God cannot be thought as a highest person. His “diagnosis” of the “personal God” error locates it in the Kantian “separation of nature ruled by physical law” (rooted in the theoretical use of reason) from “personality ruled by moral law” (rooted in the practical use of reason). 34 After Kant’s rejection of traditional ontological and cosmological proofs and his advancement of an argument for the necessity of positing God in order to reconcile the maxim of moral freedom and responsibility with the causal necessity theoretical reason detects in nature, God, says Tillich, was placed on the side of the moral law, making God “a heavenly, completely perfect person” who resides “above” the world.</p>
<p>This passage points back to Tillich’s second dissertation. There, he articulates the developments in German idealism leading up to Schelling’s break with it and the latter’s subsequent proto-existentialism. These developments culminated in an attempt to identify the idea of God as the demand of reason for a reconciliation between two principles in practical reason.</p>

<p><em>The Rise of Modern Racism in the Enlightenment</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The Enlightenment movement of the 18th century was characterized not only by this egalitarian impulse, but more generally by the tendency to look to the works of the classical Greco-Roman tradition (often radically re-read) and nature, in terms of secular science, to support the intellectual and social revolt against the Christian dogmas of the Middle Ages to create a new (or to revive the classical) tradition of Western European learning. Five main ideas or trends characterize the nascent modern racism of this intellectual movement.</p>
<p>The first is the quest to “fill in” the revised Chain of Being discussed at the end of the first section of this essay, combined with the added temporalization of this concept. The second is the “normative gaze” or system of classification within this chain based on physical appearance, particularly the divergence from the newly defined ideal. The third is the system of classification within the chain of being based upon the presence and exercise of the rational faculty. The fourth is the egalitarian impulse discussed above, and the fifth is the biological and hereditary nature of the previous three traits: physical beauty, rational thought, and a love of liberty.</p>
<p>Voltaire, perhaps the man who epitomizes the Enlightenment more than any other, epitomizes these attitudes in his “Essay on the Moors”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their round eyes, their flat nose, their lips which are always thick, their differently shaped ears, the wool on their head, the measure even of their intelligence establishes between them and other species of men prodigious differences…</p>
<p>If their understanding is not of a different nature from ours, it is at least greatly inferior. They are not capable of any great application or association of ideas, and seem formed neither in the advantages nor the abuses of our philosophy…</p>
<p>As a result of a hierarchy of nations, Negroes are thus slaves of other men &#8230; a people that sells its own children is more condemnable than the buyer; this commerce demonstrates our superiority; he who gives himself a master was born to have one.46</p></blockquote>
<p>Here the “Moors” or Black Africans in general are judged to be lower on the “hierarchy of nations” due to their physical appearance, different or lack of European modes of thinking, and lack of the love of liberty. In this revised Chain of Being, which proved so influential during the Enlightenment, Enlightened European man sits atop the chain, and all of nature is ranked below him, based on its similarity to or participation in the nature of this new ideal. In the 19th century, Hegel explicitly enunciated this doctrine declaring Western Europe “the land of the elevation of the particular to the universal,”47 and 18th century English dissident philosopher James Beattie wrote, “That every practice and sentiment is barbarous which is not according to the usages of Modern Europe seems to be a fundamental maxim with many of our critics and philosophers.”48</p>
<p>This insight was penned in response to a 1754 essay by David Hume entitled, “Of National Characters” which included the following famous footnote, “I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general all other species of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any individual eminent either in action or speculation. No ingenious, manufactures amongst them, no arts, no sciences…there are negroe slaves dispersed all over Europe, of whom none ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity.”49</p>
<p>Here Hume, ever the empiricist, says nothing of the lack of rational faculty in “all other species of men,” but comments extensively upon the lack of evidence of this faculty, “no arts, no sciences,” and here again we have another example of non-white humanity being judged as inferior to white humanity based on their apparent difference in the development of their rational, intellectual faculties. When James Beattie pointed out the tautology (Everything which is not like modern Europe is bad, non-Europeans are not like Europeans, therefore they are bad) and numerous examples of civilizations, arts, and sciences produced by non-white people, Hume retracted the footnote.</p>
<p>But why did Hume feel the need to divide the races of man into different species based on appearance, and attribute all the achievements of civilization to one of them? The French physician Francois Bernier is generally credited with the first use of the term “race” to categorize human beings based on physical appearance, primarily skin color, in his 1684 work, “<em>Nouvelle Division de la Terre par les Différentes Espèces ou Races qui l’Habitant</em>.”50</p>
<p>The categorization of man into races was seen as a part of uncovering the divinely established hierarchy or “natural order” of the entire natural world, from minerals to man. Carolus Linnaeus coined the term “natural order,” and in his <em>1735 System of Nature </em>advanced the highly influential idea that it was man’s duty to discover this “natural order” and classify everything that exists within it. Here we must return to the previously cited quotation from the 1667 Royal Society, because the continuities are so striking.</p>
<blockquote><p>And this is the highest pitch of human reason: to follow all the links of this chain till all their secrets are open to our mind and their works advanc’d or imitated by our hands. This is truly to command the world; to rank all the varieties and degrees of things so orderly upon one another; that standing on the top of them, we may perfectly behold all that are below, and make them all serviceable to the quiet and peace and plenty of Man’s life.51</p></blockquote>
<p>Within this great chain of being, “difference in kind is treated as necessarily equivalent to difference of excellence, to diversity of rank in a hierarchy.”52 Thus the quest to understand and discover the “natural order” implied its classification in a hierarchy. Although Linnaeus himself does not mention the Chain of Being explicitly in his writing, his “natural order” is clearly an 18th century manifestation of this same trope. The same is true for many of the authors of the Enlightenment; even if they do not explicitly cite classical and medieval ideas such as the chain of being or theories from Aristotle’s politics, the implicit presence and strong influence of these concepts is undeniable.<img class=" wp-image-804 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3-300x275.png" alt="3" width="344" height="315" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3-300x275.png 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3-270x247.png 270w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></p>
<p>In keeping with the anthropocentric chain of being, Linnaeus described the European race as the epitome of beauty an intelligence being, “gentle, acute, and inventive,” and the Black race as “crafty, indolent, and negligent.… Governed by caprice.”53 Furthermore, in accordance with the “continuity thesis” of the great chain model, Linnaeus posited that black women could probably mate with male apes, revealing both the place of the black race within his hierarchy (at the bottom of humanity, just above the apes), but also the role of gender in his “natural order.”54</p>
<p>The Comte de Buffon, another prominent racial theorist and natural historian of the 18th century revived the classical theories of environmental determinism to explain the variety of races within the single species of man. He maintained that man was originally white, indeed that all infants are born white, but that the influence of the environment changes the color of the skin and the formation of the body. Being an environmentalist, Buffon held that other races could become civilized, but in his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LDed3YMcCPcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>A Natural History, General and Particular </em></a>(French publication 1748-1804), he writes, “All these savages, though they never think, have a pensive, melancholy aspect.”55</p>
<p>Johann Blumenbach adopted or agreed with Buffon’s theory that man was a single species composed of a few varieties, or races, of common origin. However, he was more explicit in his classification, designating the Caucasian race56 as the original race from which the other four races, the Mongolian, the Ethiopian, American, and Malay “degenerated.” This theory was elaborated in his 1776 book <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/On_the_natural_varieties_of_mankind.html?id=gvoMAQAAMAAJ"><em>On the Natural Varieties of Mankind</em></a>, which became one of the most authoritative texts on racial classification, and remained so well into the 19th  century. Blumenbach justifies his hierarchy by arguing that the Caucasian race displays, “in general, that kind of appearance which, according to our opinion of symmetry, we consider most handsome and becoming,”57 and that its features represent is the mean around which the other races diverge.</p>
<p>This opinion shows the influence of, or at least resonance with the influential theories of J. J. Winckelmann. In 1764, Winckelmann published <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JssDAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>The History of Ancient Art Among the Greeks</em></a>, which defined the classical ideal of beauty, particularly physical beauty, for the Enlightenment. Winckelmann established rules of governing the ideal angle of the forehead, size of the eyes, nose, hands, feet, and even eyebrows. In short, Winckelmann developed and defined the physical component of the human ideal that became the basis for classifying human beings along with the rest of nature on the anthropocentric chain of being or “scale of nature.”</p>
<p>The revival of the Greek cult of the body described in the first section of this paper, found its fullest exposition in Winckelmann’s work. Cornel West describes his work as having established a “normative gaze” through or against which other human forms were judged.58 Thus, the humanity of individuals and races was judged on the basis of their conformity to or distance from this physical ideal. The importance of the physical, aesthetic dimension of the ideal form atop the modified chain of being for the development of 18th century theories about race cannot be overstated. The degree to which one differed mentally or physically from this ideal determined one’s place in the natural hierarchy, and thus one’s humanity or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant infamously demonstrated the logic of this physical/mental hierarchy by refuting the statement of a “Negro carpenter” by declaring, “this fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid.”59 While Kant followed the standard Enlightenment racial hierarchy outlined in the previous paragraphs, he contributed two significant ideas to its development: the temporalization of the Great Chain of Being and the permanence of racial heredity. While Kant followed Buffon in maintaining that black infants were born white and “blackened” by their environment, he observed that children of Africans born and raised in North America, and Europeans born and raised in the tropics maintained their racial identity in contrast to what Buffon’s environmental theory of races predicted.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kant posited that while environment could influence race over long periods of time, race was an inherent and inherited feature of people. It is important to remember that for Kant, racial inheritance did not just mean the inheritance of black or white skin, the concept of race included intelligence, beauty, and other moral characteristics such as the propensity for hard work, rational thought, and a love of liberty. Kant concludes one of his lectures on <em>Physical Geography</em>, “Humanity is at its greatest perfection in the race of the whites. The yellow Indians do have a meager talent. The Negroes are far below them and at the lowest point are a part of the American peoples.”60 This component of racial essentialism was crucial for the establishment of modern racism.</p>
<p>Kant’s other significant contribution to the rise of modern racism was his temporalization of the Great Chain of Being. Before Kant, the chain of being was largely regarded as unchanging in time, although Buffon and Blumental’s theories foreshadowed Kant’s concept of the chain of being unfolding and reaching maturity over time. That is, the plenitude of all possible forms of being in the world is not already manifested, but rather manifests throughout time, becoming more and more full and complete as time passes. This temporal and teleological conception of creation was a dramatic shift from previous doctrines, which held that creation was already completed and perfected.61</p>
<p>This notion of evolution or progress, found perhaps its fullest early philosophical expression in the works of Immanuel Kant. Kant, like many other theorists of the Enlightenment, sought to create a narrative in which the rational faculty was responsible for the linear development or progress of mankind from the “primitive” to the “civilized,” a teleological view of civilization that remains prominent in the modern world to this day.</p>

Hegel</figcaption></figure>
<p>This teleological temporalization of the Great Chain of Being found its fulfillment in Hegel’s theory of the progress of the World Soul.62 Hegel’s evolutionary theory established a temporal continuum with evil, ignorance, darkness, the past, the “primitive” and the non-white races of humanity on one end and good, knowledge, light, the future, “civilization”, progress, and the white race on the other. In his 1822-8 <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lectures+on+the+Philosophy+of+World+History+google+books&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHvo3y463PAhUJ4YMKHXbQD4AQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lectures%20on%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20World%20History%20google%20books&amp;f=false">Lectures on the Philosophy of World History</a>, </em>Hegel combined this teleology with environmental determinism and Aristotelian arguments for the right and duty of the conquest, subjugation, and even elimination of the dark side of the continuum by the light.63</p>
<p>These ideas were and are still important in justifying Western imperialism, colonization, and are implicitly invoked today in everything from development work to Marxist coups to white supremacist ideology. On Hegel’s modified, temporalized chain of being, modern, or rather future Western Man is at the top of the chain, while other segments of humanity lie further down the chain and in the past, if not outside of history all together. Thus Hegel implies that non-Europeans are subhuman because they are un-Enlightened, and his importation of racial essentialism seems to imply that they (we) may be irredeemably so.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Thus we can see how the Great Chain of Being, distorted by rationalism and temporalized, formed the philosophical backbone of modern racism. This anthropocentric chain of being generated the quest to classify and rank the human species into sub-groups and produced a physical, mental, and socio-political ideal of humanity against which all other human types were judged and ranked. Thus, a combination of scientific, biological racial essentialism and a hierarchal arrangement of these essential racial categories combined to form modern racism.</p>
<p>Racial essentialism developed from the 17th century division of humanity into races and Kant’s theory of inherited racial identity; and the ranking of races was a direct result of a particular transformation of the hierarchical cosmology of the chain of being. In this way, the philosophical foundations for modern scientific racism were established in Western Europe during the Late Medieval to the Early Modern period. Modern racism’s origins were based on a revised chain of being, with “Enlightened,” European man on top, coupled with the rise of biological racial essentialism and determinism.</p>
<p>In summary, the decline of religion and the secularization of knowledge in the West during the Renaissance and Enlightenment led to a radical reconfiguration of the cosmos, represented by the chain of being. In this reconfigured model, Western, Enlightened man, instead of God, sat atop the chain, and became the measure and master of all things. As 18th century scientists sought to discover and classify all elements of reality within this great chain, they ranked varieties of humanity based on their proximity to this ideal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rise of racial essentialism made these rankings static. In this way, medieval Europeans and contemporary members of non-white races were intellectually classified as sub-human, justifying the discriminatory and prejudiced attitudes and practices of the general European populace. This is but one angle from which to view the emergence of modern racism, but it is an important one, as it lays bare the basic philosophical structure underlying many of the diverse and divergent theories, beliefs, and actions underlying the modern forms of racism that continue to plague our societies around the world.</p>
<p>While much anti-racist literature has focused on debunking the racial essentialism of modern racism, demonstrating that race is a social construct, this analysis suggests that contemporary scholars of religion, theologians, and anti-racist/de-colonial scholars and activists should also focus their efforts on re-evaluating the legacy of the far more pervasive and implicit notions of “progress,” “reason,” and “civilization/development” that also form an integral part of modern racism, especially its more subtle varieties.64 Without attending to these dimensions of modern racism, we risk committing the same</p>

<p>error of making certain ideals of certain segments of Western Civilization (and its conquered territories) the measure of all things, again naïvely subjecting the philosophies, theologies, cultures, practices, and peoples of other civilizations and segments of humanity to the same provincial and prejudiced standards.</p>
<p>In the epigram to this article, DuBois wrote that “the darker races in other parts of the world have, in the last four centuries lagged behind the flying and even feverish footsteps of Europe.” We must critically interrogate such notions of “lagging behind,” “progress,” and “development,” and understand the history, underlying assumptions, and often unsavory concomitants of these ideas. If one were to replace “Modern Europe” with “liberal, secular, ‘developed,’ democracy,” James Beattie’s lament, “that every practice and sentiment is barbarous which is not according to the usages of Modern Europe seems to be a fundamental maxim with many of our critics and philosophers,” still rings true today.</p>

<p><em>Ethnocentrism to Modern Racism</em></p>
<p>A particularly interesting trend that occurred within or alongside the secularization of knowledge described in the previous section was the rise of modern racism. In this section, I will attempt to present a rough sketch of some of the important religious and philosophical developments related to the rise of modern racism from the medieval period (7th to 16th century) through the early modern period (16th to 18th century).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the development of racism is a staggeringly complex phenomenon, and it is impossible to do justice to the topic in the space of this paper, so I will be focusing on a few intellectual contributions from religion and philosophy to the development of modern racism which I deem representative and important. These highlighted examples are by no means exhaustive, but they attempt to highlight certain aspects of intellectual history of racism and its relationship with religion.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, I follow numerous scholars, most recently Fredrickson and Isaac in defining modern racism as a belief in the essential nature of a racial character, and the hierarchical ordering of these races/racial characters. Ethnocentrism, or the belief or attitude that one’s ethnic/cultural group is superior to all others is distinguished from modern racism in that ethnicity is not  defined as a static, essential aspect of a person’s being. Racial essentialism is all that is needed to transform the hierarchical view implicit in ethnocentrism into full-blown modern racism. The general consensus amongst the literature on the history of racism is that thus-defined, modern racism first emerged in 17th century Western Europe, despite the fact that prejudices, folk mythologies, and socio-economic motives for the development of racism existed in numerous other civilizations and societies throughout history, but the existence of elements hostile to the development of modern racism seem to have prevented its emergence.</p>
<p><em>Proto-Racism in the Classical Period</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity</a>, </em>Benjamin Isaac convincingly argues for the existence of what he terms as “proto-racism” in classical Greece and Rome. This proto-racism is distinguished from ethnocentrism, ethnic prejudice or xenophobia in that it attributes “to groups of people common characteristics considered to be unalterable because they are determined by external factors or heredity.”30</p>
<p>For example, Plato, Aristotle, and Herodotus all asserted (and Romans such as Cicero and Juvenal repeated), to one degree or another, that the nature of barbarians was similar to those of slaves, and the nature of Greeks similar to that of masters, and thus it was just that Greek should rule over barbarians, just as masters rule over slaves. Furthermore, these differences in character and nature could be explained to a large degree by the influence of climate upon the temperaments of its inhabitants, and to a lesser extent, the acquired characteristics of their ancestors. Aristotle writes in his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DJP44GomyNoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Politics</em></a></p>
<blockquote><p><em> </em>Nature would like to distinguish between the bodies of freemen and slaves, making the one strong for servile labor, the other upright, and although useless for such services, useful for political life in the arts both of war and peace. But the opposite often happens- that some have the souls and others have the bodies of freemen. And doubtless if men differed from one another in the mere forms of their bodies as much as the statues of the Gods do from men, all would acknowledge that the inferior class should be slaves of the superior. And if this is true of the body, how much more just that a similar distinction should exist in the soul? But the beauty of the body is seen, whereas the beauty of the soul is not seen.</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that some men are by nature free, and others slaves, and that for these latter slavery is both expedient and right… And again, no one would ever say he is a slave who is unworthy to be a slave. Were this the case, men of the highest rank would be slaves and the children of slaves if they or their parents chance to have been taken captive and sold. Wherefore Hellenes do not like to call Hellenes slaves, but confine the term to barbarians. Yet, in using this language, they really mean the natural slave of whom we spoke at first; for it must be admitted that some are slaves everywhere, others nowhere.31</p></blockquote>
<p>The ideas in this passage would be invoked all over Europe throughout the Medieval and particularly in the Modern period in defense of slavery and the hierarchical ordering of humanity. However, it is important to note that in this passage, Aristotle writes that “Nature <em>would like </em>to distinguish between the bodies of freemen and slaves,” but in reality, she does not. What makes a man free or a slave, noble or base, is the condition of his soul, not his body, nor his ethnicity (barbarian or Greek), nor even his status (enslaved or free), but the rank of his soul. Such opinions can be classified as proto-racist however in that many if not most Greek and Roman thinkers held that barbarians in general had souls of inferior rank due to factors such as climate and culture outside of their individual control.</p>
<p>Thus proto-racism differs from modern racism in its philosophical and scientific underpinnings. The racism of the 18th century was based on a mixture of a natural hierarchy and scientific essentialism, linking the biology of racial groups to moral and intellectual qualities, and the proto-racism of antiquity was largely based on a somewhat supernatural hierarchy and cultural and climactic determinism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the existence of prominent intellectual traditions in which differences in physical ethnicity (along with the physical world in general) were considered far more peripheral and less important to the make-up of man, mitigated these proto-racist views. In 18th century Western Europe, there were no dissenting intellectual traditions of comparable to that of neo-Platonism in the Greco-Roman world at the beginning of the millennium. According to Plotinus,</p>
<blockquote><p>None the less, in spite of physical resemblance and similar environment, we observe the <em>greatest difference </em>in tempera- ment and in ideas: this side of the human being, then, derives from some quite other Principle [than any external causa- tion or destiny]…The soul of nobler nature holds good against its surroundings; it is more apt to change them than to be changed, so that often it improves the environment and, where it must make concession, at least keeps its innocence.32</p></blockquote>
<p>However, just as the rational, materialist turn of philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment was<img class=" wp-image-793 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dragon-780x300-300x115.png" alt="dragon-780x300" width="470" height="180" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dragon-780x300-300x115.png 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dragon-780x300-768x295.png 768w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dragon-780x300-270x104.png 270w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dragon-780x300.png 780w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /> pre-figured in the late classical period, Isaac’s work demonstrates the pre-figuration of modern racism in the rise of proto-racism in the late classical period (after 5 B.C.) and Roman Empire. While the argument advanced in the first half of this paper is one possible explanation for the co-occurrence of these trends in antiquity, such an analysis is outside of the scope of this paper, and the fact that the rationalist, materialist turn of the late Greek and Roman intellectual traditions and the post-Renaissance intellectual tradition produced or coincided with similar ideas of racial essentialism can only be seen as circumstantial evidence for this argument. In any event, it is clear from Isaac’s work that Renaissance and Enlightenment scholars revived proto-racist concepts and ideas and derived much of their theories of race from these classical sources.</p>
<p><em>Proto-Racism in the Medieval Period</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The literature on race in the medieval Islamic world suggests that while the infidel-believer distinction trumped ethnic and cultural differences, this distinction was often conflated with ethnicity such that strong ethnic prejudices bordering on what Isaac would call “proto-racism” existed under the guise of religious discrimination. Furthermore, the early medieval period was marked by Arab prejudice against non-Arabs and increased interest in heredity and purity of blood. The religious injunction against enslaving fellow Muslims led to the importation of a large number of slaves from sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe and led to an association between sub-Saharan Africans and slavery.33</p>
<p>However, given that heredity was primarily paternally determined (for example, Arab royal families often had maternal African, Persian, and even European ancestry due to the diversity of the wives and concubines of even the rulers of “pure” Arab blood), notions of ethnicity and ethnic hierarchy were far more fluid and detached from physical appearance than in the European classical and medieval worlds. Furthermore, the dominance of Islam in the intellectual and social traditions of the Muslim world continued until the colonial period, and its explicit anti-racial doctrines mitigated these trends of ethnic prejudice by emphasizing the piety and faith of individuals over and above their ethnicity.34</p>
<p>The Christian doctrine of universalism expressed by the apostle Paul as, “For as many as you were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus,”35 also played a significant role in the suppression of ethnic prejudice and racism within medieval Christendom. As in the Muslim world, religion trumped ethnicity officially, but given the relative ethnic homogeneity and insularity of medieval Western Europe as compared to the medieval Muslim and Byzantine worlds, ethnicity and religion were often conflated. To be European meant to be Christian and to be Christian meant to be European.</p>
<p>Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible to separate the ethnic and religious dimensions in negative depictions and descriptions of non-Europeans in the early medieval period. During this period, foreigners, particularly black Africans, were seen as threatening, even demonic heathens (due in large part to the powerful, and expanding Muslim polities which were conquering Europe’s Christian North African neighbors at the time) on the one hand, and a powerful symbol of the universalism and sanctity of Christianity36 on the other. The image of the foreigner as a depraved heathen seems to have reached its peak in the years leading up to the beginning of the 10th Century CE, after which the image of the foreign Christian demonstrating the universality of the Church became more dominant.</p>

St. Maurice (his name means Moor) became the patron Saint of the Holy Roman Emperors, and in 926, Henry I went so far as to cede the present Swiss canton of Aargau to an abbey in return for the saint’s lance, sword and spurs. Due to his Egyptian heritage, St. Moritz was often depicted as a “black Moor” or sub-Saharan African and he was increasingly venerated in the High Middle Ages in Germany and Bohemia, and a 13th century image of him adorns the Cathedral of Magdeburg next to the grave of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I. However, the status of St. Maurice and other black saints such as Benedict the Moor began to decline in the mid 16th century, probably due to the influence of the African slave trade and the association of blackness with slavery and religio-cultural otherness.37</p>
<p>Until the advent of African slave trade, however, Western Europeans had relatively little interaction with Sub-Saharan Africans. The medieval Christian encounter with the Jewish population in Europe was to have much greater influence on the development of ideas of race and racial hierarchy in the Western intellectual tradition during this period.</p>
<p>“Jews created a special problem for Christians because of the latter’s belief that the New Testament superseded the Old, and that the refusal of Jews to recognize Christ as the Messiah was preventing the triumph of the gospel,” writes Fredrickson in his study of the history of racism. “Anti-Judaism was endemic to Christianity from the beginning, but since the founders of the religion were themselves Jews, it would have been very difficult for early Christians to claim there was anything defective about Jewish blood or ancestry.”38 This however, changed during the medieval period, as the Jews of Europe became associated with the Jews of the gospel crucifixion who declared, “His blood be upon us and our Children.”39 Jews were increasingly and collectively held responsible for the “worst possible human crime,” that is, deicide.</p>
<p>However, the conversion of the Jews was seen as an important Christian duty and indeed even essential to the salvation of the world based on certain prophecies in the New Testament. Bewildered and frustrated by what must have been perceived as the Jews’ continued refusal to convert and assimilate, and motivated by xenophobia, conflicting economic interests, and martial holy fervor stirred up by the Crusades, the populace of Western Europe began massacring Jews shortly after the First Crusade. To the church and aristocracy however, Jews were useful as fiscal agents, and were tolerated, and sometimes even protected from these mobs. However, at the popular level, a growing folk mythology depicted Jews as inherently evil, still open to the possibility of conversion to Christianity, but inherently opposed to it because of their Jewish heredity. This is one of the first and most important instances of ethnic or racial essentialism linked to an ontological hierarchy in medieval thought.</p>
<p>However, this view remained little more than a folk belief as officially and intellectually, medieval theologians and philosophers held that Jews were ontologically inferior to Christians because of their religion, not their heredity. But this would change in the 16th century. Certain other predominantly-Christian ethnic/cultural groups faced discrimination, ghettoization, and persecution in the late Middle Ages as national identities and cultures began to emerge. The Irish were segregated into separate “Irishtowns” and were legally barred from trade guilds and from marrying Englishmen or women in 14th-century colonial Ireland. Similarly, Slavs and Germans were forbidden to intermarry in the Holy Roman Empire during his period, and German descent was a requirement for holding certain political offices and membership in guilds.</p>
<p>However, such policies were frequently denounced if not actively opposed by the Church as unjust mistreatment of fellow Christians. Fredrickson writes, “What was missing – and why I think such ethnic discrimination should not be labeled racist – was an ideology or worldview that would persuasively justify such practices…these ethnic exclusions were usually the self-interested action of conquering families and lineages and were likely to be condemned by church authorities…”.40 The declining power of the Roman Catholic Church and the emergence of the secular intellectual tradition would allow for the development of such ideologies and worldviews which could support and justify such practices. The most relevant example can be found in 16th -century Spain and the emergence of what I call Iberian proto-racism.</p>
<p>After the completion of the so-called Spanish <em>Reconquista </em>in 1492, threatened with expulsion or death, over a half million Iberian Jews and Muslims converted to Christianity. The converted Muslims, known as <em>Moriscos</em>, were severely persecuted and remained segregated second-class citizens until nearly their entire population was expelled from Spain during the first 20 years of the 17th century. The Jewish converts, known as <em>conversos, </em>were better integrated into Spanish society, and were much more numerous, although they faced serious discrimination on account of their ancestry. They were particularly targeted by the Spanish Inquisition who viewed their Jewish ancestry and cultural distinctiveness as a signs that they had not fully accepted Catholicism, and were prone to revert to Judaism.</p>
<p>The notion of <em>limpieza de sangre </em>(purity of blood), meaning Christian ancestry, became a popular and important belief and even doctrine which was used to define status, Spanish identity, and discriminate against <em>conversos </em>during this period. Several Spanish institutions, including the bishopric of Toledo, and local governments required certificates of pure blood for membership or employment. The concept of “noble blood” was nothing new to Spain, but the large-scale discrimination against a population, and denigration of “blood” based not on nobility but ethnicity was a significant development. As before, this doctrine was justified by the argument that Jewish “blood” made one more resistant to embracing Christianity, but now this folk belief was officially endorsed as doctrine by many officials in the Spanish church.</p>
<p>In light of Lully’s statement on the hierarchy of creation, “The likenesses to the divine nature are imprinted upon every creature according to that creature’s receptive capacities, greater or less in each case…”, Jews perceived lesser degree of receptivity to Christianity equaled a lower placement on the chain of being and therefore the hierarchy of humanity. This may be the first, and certainly was the most prominent case in which ethnicity was officially linked to an ontological hierarchy in post-classical European thought. That is, this seems to be the first time that Jews, or any other people, were officially and doctrinally designated as subhuman due to their ancestry, not their religion. Fredrickson writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>16th and 17th century Spain is critical to the history of Western racism because its attitudes and practices served as a kind of segue between the religious intolerance of the Middle Ages and the naturalistic racism of the modern era. The idiom remained religious, and what was inherited through the “blood” was a propensity to heresy or unbelief rather than intellectual and emotional inferiority. Innocent “savages” who embraced Spanish civilization and Catholicism did not carry impure blood. Discrimination against Indians persisted after they were baptized, but it was based on culture more than ancestry. <em>Mestizos </em>who had adopted Spanish ways could be admitted to religious orders that excluded Jewish <em>conversos.</em>41</p></blockquote>
<p>Another important development in history of proto-racism in Spain was the famous debate between <img class=" wp-image-797 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aztec-warriors-209x300.jpg" alt="aztec-warriors" width="384" height="551" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aztec-warriors-209x300.jpg 209w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aztec-warriors-188x270.jpg 188w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aztec-warriors.jpg 453w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" />Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda and Bartolomé de las Casas over the nature and therefore, status of the native inhabitants of Spain’s new colonial territories. Sepúlveda argued that all native Americans belonged to the Aristotelian category of “natural slaves,” and thus were not in full possession of the rational faculty, and could and should be made useful to the Spanish through enslavement.</p>
<p>Las Casas described the native American indigenes as living under Aristotle and Aquinas’ “natural law” and invoked the Biblical doctrines of Christian universalism to argue that they were potential converts, and thus fellow human beings. Las Casas won the debate, setting the course of official Spanish religious and state doctrine for converting and schooling the “innocent savages” of the new world in Christianity and civilization rather than enslaving them. Following this debate, Pope Paul III issued a bull against slavery, entitled <em>Sublimis Deus</em>, in the year 1537. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;The exalted God loved the human race so much that He created man in such a condition that he was not only a sharer in good as are other creatures, but also that he would be able to reach and see face to face the inaccessible and invisible Supreme Good&#8230; Seeing this and envying it, the enemy of the human race, who always opposes all good men so that the race may perish, has thought up a way, unheard of before now, by which he might impede the saving word of God from being preached to the nations.</p>
<p>He (Satan) has stirred up some of his allies who, desiring to satisfy their own avarice, are presuming to assert far and wide that the Indians&#8230;be reduced to our service like brute animals, under the pretext that they are lacking the Catho- lic faith. And they reduce them to slavery, treating them with afflictions they would scarcely use with brute animals&#8230; by our Apostolic Authority decree and declare by these present letters that the same Indians and <em>all other peoples </em>&#8211; even though they are outside the faith &#8211; &#8230;should not be deprived of their liberty&#8230; Rather they are to be able to use and enjoy this liberty and this ownership of property freely and licitly, and are not to be reduced to slavery&#8230;[emphasis mine]42</p></blockquote>
<p>However, given the declining temporal power of the Church (sovereigns were no longer cowed by the threat of excommunication, and in fact the Popes often had to bow to political pressures from military and political leaders), Spanish practice differed, often significantly, from official doctrine. Nevertheless, even if this doctrine was not effective in dictating the behavior of conquistadors and colonists, it remained influential in shaping their worldviews. For example, Europeans in general preferred buying already enslaved people, to enslaving people themselves, not only saving themselves labor, time, and money, but cleverly eluding the papal interdiction against “depriving” peoples of their liberty. The Spanish also followed another one of Las Casas’ suggestions from the debate, using Africa as a source of slave labor.</p>
<p>The medieval Spanish predominantly encountered sub-Saharan Africans as the slaves of the lighter- skinned Moors, since the Moors, like the medieval Christians were forbidden to enslave members of their own religion, the cheapest source of slave labor in the Maghreb were the non-Muslim peoples of the Western Sahel. The medieval Moors also held light-skinned slaves from Europe, North Africa, and even Asia, but due to their higher price, they were spared the more menial and physical tasks which fell to the African slaves.43</p>
<p>Thus, even before the advent of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the Spanish had come to associate Sub-Saharan Africans with menial labor and slavery, and Aristotelian category of “natural slave.” As the last Slavic groups in the east converted to Christianity in the early 16th century and the Europeans gradually stopped selling each other as slaves, Portuguese navigators opened up the West African slave market, and the colonial missions and papal interdiction against enslaving “Indians” created a strong demand for labor in the New World.</p>
<p>The brutal exportation and exploitation of African slaves “fit the bill” for many reasons, among which are that the Spanish and Portuguese already associated sub-Saharan Africans with menial slave labor, they could buy African slaves and did not need to enslave them, circumventing potential problems with the Church, and being heathens, Africans were not entitled to the same kinds of rights or considered to be of the level of humanity as other Christians. In fact, the Protestant Dutch and English limited missionary activity within their slave colonies because slave-owners worried that baptism would give the enslaved a claim to freedom. Simultaneously, however, slave traders and plantation owners presented their activities to the Church as part of a civilizing/Christianizing mission.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church and the newly formed Protestant denominations both condemned and were simultaneously complicit in both the brutal institutions of the exportation of Africans across the Atlantic and their exploitation in the New World. However, the official intellectual position of the majority of religious figures during the 16th and early 17th centuries remained that of Christian universalism, even in the face of racialized slavery and popular justifications such as the curse of Ham.44 The racialized nature of the Atlantic slave trade is best understood as an example of popular European thought and practice ignoring or circumventing the crumbling political, moral, and intellectual authority of the Church. In this case, popular practice and belief in proto-racism preceded its intellectual justification.</p>
<p>Thus the stage was set for the rise of modern racism in the 18th century. The official medieval doctrine of Christian universalism was weakened by the anti-Semitism of the Spanish Inquisition which enshrined popular beliefs about the resistance of Jews to Christianity in official doctrine, and consistent with the logic of the medieval chain of being, classified them as subhuman, providing an official religious and intellectual justification for their persecution. By asserting that <em>conversos, </em>although Christian, were inferior due to their ethnicity, Iberian proto-racism developed the idea of racial essentialism.</p>
<p>Moreover, the classification of Black Africans as Aristotelian “natural slaves,” Indians as “innocent savages living under natural law,” and the Spanish as the defenders and champions of the “One True Faith” created a color-coded racial hierarchy. In Iberian proto-racism we find both the beginnings of racial essentialism and racial hierarchy, but “to achieve its full potential as an ideology, racism had to be liberated from Christian universalism.”45 Although the Catholic Church, and Christianity in general, lost much political power and intellectual control during this period, the intellectual authority of basic Christian doctrines such as universalism had not yet been directly challenged by secular ideologies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the medieval social hierarchy also had to be overturned for modern racism to emerge. In medieval society, social inequality based on birth was nearly universal, as everyone from the king to the peasant found him or herself in a hereditary social position, and to be human meant to be part of a hierarchy. The enslaved status of Africans in particular fit this general pattern of hierarchal social arrangements, and thus did not necessarily exclude them from the sphere of humanity.</p>
<p>Their enslaved status could not fully contribute to their philosophical dehumanization until this status became intellectually and socially exceptional, as it did in the 18th century Enlightenment, when human relations came to be viewed as egalitarian. Paradoxically, the rise of egalitarianism contributed to the dehumanization of Africans in particular, but also of other races of humanity, in that their position outside of egalitarian societies marked them as being outside of human society.</p>

<p>44. From the story of Genesis 9:20-7 in which Noah cursed the descendants of his son Ham for his indiscretion. The curse actually refers to Ham’s son Canaan, “And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren” (verse 25). Although the Torah assigns no racial characteristics to Ham, the Cushites and Egyptians are numbered amongst his progeny, however these “black” peoples are not numbered amongst the descendants of Canaan in the Torah, and thus it assigns no racial characteristics to the The association of the curse of slavery with dark skin apparently originated in the Rabbinic literature and later entered classical Christian and Islamic literature where it was strongly contested by a number of scholars who pointed out that the curse was on Canaan, the progenitor of the Philistines, and not Ham himself. Despite these intellectual refutations, the story remained a popular, but contested, explanation and justification for the enslavement of dark-skinned peoples from the 3rd century through the 20th.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The medieval European world… knew the black man chiefly as a legend or occasional curiosity, but still as a fellow man… The modern world in contrast, knows the Negro chiefly as a bond slave in the West Indies and America.

<p>W.E.B. DuBois. <em>The Negro</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Western European Civilization is unique among world civilizations for many reasons, most obviously because it was the birthplace of the modernity within which nearly every human on the planet now lives and works and thinks. It also is unique because it is the birthplace of two important intellectual/social perspectives or trends: the secular and the racist.</p>
<p>Limited materialist and “secularist” movements can be found in classical Indian, Chinese, and especially the late Greek and Roman civilizations, but these perspectives were always marginal, and never achieved the intellectual prominence and indeed dominance that the secular perspective enjoyed and enjoys in post-Enlightenment Western Civilization and the modernity it spawned. It was in the post-medieval Western Europe where the schism between reason and religion, philosophy and faith, science and mysticism that characterizes modern and post-modern thought was fully realized.1</p>
<p>Similarly, it seems fair to claim that every society in the history of humankind has stereotyped and denigrated outsiders to one degree or another, but modern racism, defined here as racial essentialism coupled with a hierarchal ranking of races, is a phenomenon that appears to have arisen only in post- Enlightenment Europe. For example, many prominent Greek philosophers, such as Plato and Aristotle, believed that the Greeks were superior to all other people in the world, whom they designated as barbarians, but this Greek/barbarian distinction was less essential and biological and more linguistic and cultural, so that a barbarian could become a Greek and vice-versa.</p>
<p>In this article I would like to examine the role of the first trend, that is, the shift from a religious, hiero- or theocentric perspective to the modern secular, anthropocentric perspective, played in the rise of the second trend, modern racism. I will argue that the latter took place within the former, and that the decline of religion in the West was <em>sine qua non </em>for the rise of modern racism.</p>
<p>From the outset, it should be recognized that the emergence of modern racism is a many-faceted, and exceedingly complex intellectual, social, and economic phenomenon, and that I only intend to examine one among the many influential factors that contributed to the rise of this uniquely troubling element of modernity. Furthermore, in asserting that racism did not exist in non-Western, non-modern societies, I am in no way proposing that prejudice, discrimination, and violence against groups did not exist.</p>
<p>On the contrary, history is replete with such examples. However, since the concept of race as a biological, essential, and static entity was born in post-Enlightenment Europe, modern racism, the classification and discrimination amongst groups based on race, could only arise out of this particular intellectual climate.2</p>
<p><em>Man in the Image of God to God in the Image of Man</em></p>
<p>The most relevant aspect of the secularization of the Western intellectual tradition is the effect the schism between the rational and the religious had upon the intellectual theories of the nature of man.3 This shift is best summarized as a move from the perspective of man as <em>imago Dei </em>to the modern perspective of God as an invention of man, and the humanist position of the inherent dignity and worth of all people by virtue of their humanity in and of itself, not because of their deiform nature. Although the nature of man in medieval European thought was complex and varied, the prevailing perspective is summarized by St. Thomas Aquinas in his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-Rco1YlFj8EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Summa Theologicae</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since man is said to be the image of God by reason of his intellectual nature, he is the most perfectly like God according to that in which he can best imitate God in his intellectual nature. Now the intellectual nature imitates God chiefly in this, that God understands and loves Himself. Wherefore we see that the image of God is in man in three ways.</p>
<p>First, inasmuch as man possesses a natural aptitude for understanding and loving God; and this aptitude consists in the very nature of the mind, which is common to all men.</p>
<p>Secondly, inasmuch as man actually and habitually knows and loves God, though imperfectly; and this image consists in the conformity of grace.</p>
<p>Thirdly, inasmuch as man knows and loves God perfectly; and this image consists in the likeness of glory. Wherefore on the words, “The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us” (Psalm 4:7), the gloss distinguishes a threefold image of “creation,” of “re-creation,” and of “likeness.” The first is found in all men, the second only in the just, the third only in the blessed.4</p></blockquote>
<p>There are three important elements of this perspective: first is its definition of man as a fundamentally theomorphic being, second the location of the essence of this theomorphism, and thus the nature of man himself with the intellectual faculty, and thirdly, the ranking of humanity based on the degree of theomorphism (all men, the just, and the blessed).5 Naturally, these three elements played a significant role in the reconfiguration of the image of man in general, and of certain groups of humanity in particular which resulted in racism.</p>
<p>The 13th century scholastic Lully further elucidated this first concept of theomorphism in his <em>Compendium </em><em>Artis Demonstrativae</em>, “The likenesses to the divine nature are imprinted upon every creature according to that creature’s receptive capacities, greater or less in each case&#8230; thus every creature carries, more or less, the sign of its Maker.”6 This description of the graded theomorphism of creation is an example of the cosmological perspective of “The Great Chain of Being” which enjoyed great prominence, if not eminence throughout the history of Western thought, from the classical period, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance and well into the modern period.7</p>
<p>A. Lovejoy’s definitive work on the subject, <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5u3HZjTpkTgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea</a>, </em>locates its beginning in the Platonic dialogue <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=q2YMAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=timaeus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj44cP04pnPAhWj2YMKHfKoDq4Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=timaeus&amp;f=false"><em>Timaeus</em></a>, wherein the issue of theodicy, or the origin of evil in the world given the Absolute nature of the Platonic “Good” or God, is explained by appeal to the simultaneously Infinite nature of this Supreme Entity. Being infinite, the Good must manifest itself in all possible ways, and this is the origin of the creation of the universe from the gods on down to gross matter.</p>
<p>All creation is a manifestation of the single Divine Principle, which by its Infinite nature must manifest itself in all possible forms, including those forms which are ugly, evil, or bad. These ugly/evil/bad forms are “privations” of the Principle the way shadows are a privation of light, but they must exist, otherwise the Divine Principle would be lacking in plenitude, and would not be perfect. Thus the imperfections of the world are the result of the perfection of plenitude of the Principle.</p>
<p>The <em>Timaeus </em>dialogue sets up a model of the Universe with the expansive Good presiding above a vague hierarchy of creation, graded according to the presence of the Good in the various forms of manifestation, or inversely, the degree of privation of these forms. Although Aristotle rejected the principle of plenitude inherent in this model, his insistence of the continuity of nature was to be combined with the Platonic principle of plenitude to complete the picture of the hierarchy outlined in <em>Timaeus</em>. Furthermore, Lovejoy argues that it was Aristotle “who chiefly suggested to the naturalists and philosophers of later times the idea of arranging (at least) all animals in a single graded <em>scala naturae </em>according to their degree of ‘perfection’.”8</p>
<p>The Great Chain of Being found its fullest classical exposition in the work of Plotinus, the most prominent figure or even founder of Neo-Platonism. Plotinus unites the principles of plenitude and continuity in his elaborate ontology which explains the creation of the Universe as a series of emanations from the perfect, self-sufficient, infinite, Absolute. “The One is perfect because it seeks for nothing and possesses nothing, and has need of nothing; and being perfect it overflows, and thus its superabundance produces an Other.”9</p>
<p>This first emanation from the hypostasis of the One is described as a result of its self-contemplation</p>

<p>producing an image of itself, which is the second hypostasis of the <em>Nous </em>or Universal Intellect of the supra-sensible world of the Forms. The <em>nous’ </em>contemplation of its origin, the One, empowers and “impregnates” it, allowing its self-contemplation to give rise to a second emanation and hypostasis, the <em>Psyche </em>or the dynamic “Universal Soul.” The <em>Psyche </em>is also not content “to remain within itself” but, “first looking back upon that from which it proceeded, it is thereby filled full and then going forward in the opposite direction, it generates an image of itself,”10 which is itself the sensible world. The sensible world is so removed from the One (the source of all) that it possess neither the faculty of self-contemplation nor the contemplation of its origin, and thus the chain of emanations ends in the sensible world of barely or non-sentient matter.11</p>
<p>This process of emanation is driven, governed, and limited only by the laws of logical necessity. Anything that is must be, and anything that can be is. Furthermore, all of existence is part of a grand hierarchy, ranked according to its participation in the nature of the Good. “The world is a sort of Life stretched out to an immense span, in which each of the parts its own place in the series, all of them different, and yet the whole continuous, and that which precedes never wholly absorbed in that which comes after.”12</p>
<p>This is the cosmological perspective which the medieval scholars, particularly the Neo-Platonists, adopted and used as a foundation for their own theories and doctrines. The clear resonances, if not genealogical relationship, between the theomorphism of Lully and Aquinas and Plotinus’ “participation in the nature of the Good” is sufficiently obvious to require no further comment here. Lovejoy quotes Macrobius, a 5th century CE Roman Neo-Platonist who provides a fundamental summary of the doctrine in Latin,</p>
<blockquote><p>Since from the Supreme God Mind arises, and from Mind, Soul, and since this in turn creates all subsequent things and fills them all with life and since this single radiance illumines all and is reflected in each, as a single face might be reflected in many mirrors placed in a series; and since all things follow in continuous succession, degenerating in sequence to the very bottom of the series, the attentive observer will discover a connection of parts, from the Supreme God own to the last dregs of things, mutually linked together and without break. And this is Homer’s golden chain, which God, he says, bade hang down from heaven to earth.13</p></blockquote>
<p>With the necessary Christian modifications, this became the dominant medieval cosmological doctrine, wherein every aspect of nature, from different types of metals to species of plants and animals to different types of men,14 could be assigned a place in the cosmic hierarchy. Lovejoy writes, “The result was the conception of the plan and structure of the universe which, through the Middle Ages and down to the late eighteenth century, many philosophers, most men of science, and indeed most educated men, were to accept without question – the conception of the universe as a ‘Great Chain of Being’.”</p>
<p>Since this was the dominant view of the intellectuals who first formulated secular philosophy and science in general, and racial essentialism and hierarchy in particular, the place that man occupied in this hierarchy is of particular relevance. For Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists in general,</p>
<blockquote><p>Man has come into existence, a living being but not a member of the noblest order; he occupies by choice an intermediate rank; still, in that place in which he exists, Providence does not allow him to be reduced to nothing; on the contrary he is ever being led upwards by all those varied devices which the Divine employs in its labour to increase the dominance of moral value&#8230;. Man is, therefore, a noble creation, as perfect as the scheme allows; a part, no doubt, in the fabric of the All, he yet holds a lot higher than that of all the other living things of earth.15</p></blockquote>
<p>The medieval scholastics generally followed the classical neo-Platonists in ranking man as the highest living creature on earth, “a little lower than the angels”16 (the celestial realm of the angels took the place of the Platonic world of forms in Christian Platonism) and above the beasts of the air, land, and sea. But what are we to make of these “varied devices?” of the Divine and what of the hierarchy of men within humankind? People clearly differ from each other and as Lovejoy explains, in the doctrine of the Great Chain of Being, “Difference of kind is treated as necessarily equivalent to difference of excellence, to diversity of rank in a hierarchy.”17</p>
<p>To answer these questions we must turnto themicrocosmic or psychological dimensions of this doctrine. In Plotinus’ exposition, the individual human soul is a fragment of <em>Psyche</em>, the third hypostasis or Universal Soul, but this fragment is further divided hierarchically into three related but distinct elements or faculties. The Irrational or Animal soul is limited to physical desires and emotional passions and occupies the lowest rung of this hierarchy. Above it sits the Rational Soul, which is the highest level of the ordinary  human psyche, but it is limited to discursive reason and speculation.</p>
<p>At the summit of the soul is the Intellect or <em>nous</em>, identified with the second hypostasis of the same name, it is unfallen and does not descend into the sensory world, but remains in perpetual contemplation of the eternal and universal <em>Nous </em>(indeed the former <em>is </em>the latter’s self-contemplation), which in turn is in eternal contemplation of the One.18 This view was popular amongst Muslim and Christian Platonists, neo-Platonists, and mystics alike during the Middle Ages, and even influenced the understandings of Aristotle, particularly Ibn Sina’s (Avicenna’s) and his school.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3PCeTiwL7dsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">De Anima</a> (III.3-5), Aristotle divides the soul (<em>psyche </em>in Greek and <em>anima </em>in Latin) into the vegetative soul which has the capacity for self-nourishment and reproduction, the animal soul which has the capacity for sensory perception and self-movement, and the intellect (<em>nous </em>in Greek and <em>intellectus </em>in Latin), which unlike the other two souls can exist apart from a body, and has the capacity for intuition, rational thought and memory.</p>
<p>Aristotle further divides the <em>nous </em>into an active intellect (<em>nous poietikos / intellectus agens</em>) which is separate, immortal, and eternal, and a passive intellect (<em>nous pathetikos / intellectus possibilis) </em>a term whose meaning has been subject to extensive debate since the time of Aristotle himself, but which is generally held to be associated with the rational and mental faculties which are affected by knowledge. In medieval Scholasticism this view was combined with neo-Platonic doctrines to produce the distinct concepts of the intellect (<em>intellectus</em>), a divine, sometimes uncreated, faculty of human beings through which they directly perceive God and divine truths, and the rational faculty (<em>ratio</em>), the seat of reason and discursive thought (<em>dianoia</em>), ranked lower than the intellect.</p>
<p>Ibn Rushd, or Averroes, author of the most famous medieval commentaries on the Aristotelian corpus, somewhat blurred the distinction between the active and passive intellect, and posited that both were universal, existing as one outside of individual human beings, in contrast to Ibn Sina who posited that only the active intellect was universal, the passive intellect being individual. Averroes was also more of a pure Aristotelian than Avicenna, and eliminated the angelic world from his cosmology. Although his work did not become popular in the Muslim world, he was held in great reverence by Dante, and in scholastic tradition he was known simply as “The Commentator,” so extensive was the influence of his commentaries upon Aristotle (they formed the basis of much of Thomas Aquinas’ work).</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-742 alignleft" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7fd9fcc1c4d2179d1a16383f6da91aaf-161x300.jpg" alt="7fd9fcc1c4d2179d1a16383f6da91aaf" width="371" height="691" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7fd9fcc1c4d2179d1a16383f6da91aaf-161x300.jpg 161w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7fd9fcc1c4d2179d1a16383f6da91aaf-145x270.jpg 145w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7fd9fcc1c4d2179d1a16383f6da91aaf.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" />Some have linked the influence of Averroes’ Aristotelian thought in 12th century Europe to the increasing rational and this-worldly, and even secular turn of thought leading up to the 17th century in contrast to the markedly other-worldly and Platonic/neo-Platonic thought which characterized the early Middle Ages. The validity of this argument is outside of the scope of this article,19 but the overall trend in thought is highly significant, and we will return to it shortly.</p>
<p>Returning to the hierarchy of human beings, Aquinas had previously given us the tripartite distinction between all men, the just, and the blessed, based on their knowledge, love, and likeness to God. Conforming with the doctrine of the Great Chain of Being, an individual human’s place on the hierarchy of existence is determined by his participation in the nature of the Good, that is the degree to which he conforms to the image of God. In medieval neo-Platonic Christian thought, the participation of the nature of the Good in man is accomplished through the intellect (<em>nous</em>), often identified with the immanent Holy Spirit, and it is the degree to which the soul is governed by and identified with the intellect that determines man’s place on the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Aquinas provides a summary of the more Aristotelian version of this view, “While in all creatures there is some kind of likeness to God, in the rational creature alone we find a likeness of “image” as we have explained above (1,2); whereas in other creatures we find a likeness by way of a “trace.” Now the intellect or mind is that whereby the rational creature excels other creatures; wherefore this image of God is not found even in the rational creature except in the mind.”20 Given that an individual (and indeed everything else) is ranked on this version of the Chain of Being according to his likeness to God, it is the degree of intellect, the image of God in man, which determines one’s ranking in the cosmic hierarchy.</p>
<p>Here, in contrast to the more Platonic and Neo-Platonic strands of thought, we see that the rational faculty or “mind” also plays a prominent role in this account. This will be significant for the future of the Chain of Being in the rational Enlightenment. But even more significant is the degree to which the body or any physical characteristic of an individual is downplayed or completely ignored. Aquinas writes further, “Man is called to the image of God; not that he is essentially an image; but that the image of God is impressed on his mind; as a coin is an image of the king, as having the image of the king. Wherefore there is no need to consider the image of God as existing in every part of man.”21</p>
<p>This lack of attention to the physical and material aspects of both man and nature was characteristic of much of medieval Christian thought, and was highly influential in the course of Western Civilization. Here however, it significance merely lies in the fact that the dominant ontological hierarchy of humans of medieval Europe downplayed if not ignored the physical aspects of humans and focused on the spiritual/ intellectual sphere where the <em>imago Dei </em>was located. The greater the likeness to God or Christ, as achieved through acceptance of Christian doctrine, orthodox practice, and grace, the higher on the Chain of Being one was.</p>
<p>Thus saints occupied the places on the chain nearest the angels, and sinners the levels nearest the beasts. Dante’s cosmology, as elaborated in his Divine Comedy, placed respected heathens such as Cicero, Averroes, Aristotle, and Plato in Limbo since they conformed to the image of God insofar as it was deemed possible through the “natural revelation” of their own natures and the natural world. Thus, it can be seen why a hierarchical ordering of human beings based on physical characteristics was impossible in this intellectual climate—the physical characteristics of human beings, and matter in general, simply didn’t matter enough.</p>
<p>All of this changed however with the advent of the Renaissance and the rise of humanism. Humanism began as a mode of learning opposed to the medieval scholastic method of resolving contradictions between commentaries and authors, humanists would study ancient texts in the original, and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence. Although a markedly diverse movement, early humanism has been characterized as “the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome”22 in Western Europe which focused on the “the genius of man &#8230; the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind,” in the words of the early Florentine humanist Gianozzo Mannetti.</p>
<p>It is significant that these words were written in a 1452 work entitled <em>De dignitate et excellentia hominis libri IV </em>(“On the Dignity and Excellence of Man in Four Books”), a direct response to Pope Innocent III’s <em>De miseria humane conditionis </em>(On the Misery of the Human Condition). This strong reaction if not rebellion against church authority characterized much of European intellectual activity from the late 15th century until the late 18th century, when the Western European intellectual tradition had virtually broken free of the dominion of the Roman Catholic church.</p>
<p>During the late Middle Ages (13th and 14th century) the Roman Catholic Church reached the height of its political power and established its hegemony over the Western intellectual tradition through the institution of the centralized Papal Inquisition in 1233 and the rigid enforcement and adoption of Aristotelianism as official Church doctrine on matters philosophical and natural. Perhaps as a result of the endorsement of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly those forms influenced by Averroes,  this period is characterized by a marked exteriorization of thought: a transition from the preoccupation with the spiritual or internal world associated with the intellect and the noetic world of Forms/angelic realities to a  focus  on  the external, physical world associated with the rational faculty and sensory perception.</p>
<p>The French cultural anthropologist and literary critic Gilbert Durand describes it thusly, “In the thirteenth century…the Church established its temporal hegemony and Avicenna’s philosophy was replaced by that of Averroes. This made it possible for Aristotelian physics to become the prescientific way of knowing the world of <em>res </em>as separate from the world of <em>voces</em>. This consequently cut Western  man off from direct access to transcendence,”23   in  Platonic  and  Neo-Platonic  doctrines,  this  direct  access  to  transcendence  was  the  <em>nous  </em>or  Intellect.</p>
<p>However, during this period and the Early Modern/Renaissance period which followed it, the concept of the supra-rational intellect and its direct perception of philosophical/spiritual forms and truths declined, and was eclipsed by the more Aristotelian notion of a united rational faculty/intellect. Finally, by the time the humanists of the Renaissance were translating classical texts from the original Greek and Latin, the intellect had all but disappeared behind the rational faculty.24</p>
<p>The elimination of the intellect from the anthropology of man was of tremendous significance in philosophy, religion, and science. It was a short philosophical step from the proto-rationalism of the late Aristotelians and Renaissance humanists to the rationalism and empiricism which characterized the 17th century Age of Reason, epitomized by the philosophies of Descartes and Bacon. Descartes and the rationalists focused on the rational faculty (by this point a conglomeration of late Aristotelian and revived Stoic ideas) as the primary source of knowledge, whereas the empiricists, led by Bacon, focused on the sensory faculty as the primary source of knowledge. Except among a small school of Italian neo-Platonists and Hermeticists,25 the supra-rational Intellect was no longer considered the primary source of knowledge.</p>
<p>Naturally, the loss of this faculty in the microcosm was accompanied by the loss of the level of reality to which it corresponded in the macrocosm, and thus the elaborate angeologies and cosmologies of medieval Europe disappeared from mainstream intellectual life and thought. Furthermore, the rational faculty replaced the <em>nous </em>as the <em>imago Dei </em>in man in late Aristotelianism and the early modern period.26 But as God himself was no longer directly perceived by the <em>nous</em>, but abstracted from sensory data and the rational faculty, his role in Western intellectual thought became more and more vague and distant, culminating in the 19th-century view that he was an invention of the mind of man.27 Naturally, this trend was concurrent with the gradual separation of theology and philosophy.</p>
<p>These shifts, however, did not do away with the paradigm of the Great Chain of Being, rather, as Lovejoy records, it remained an important concept around which philosophers and scientists continued to organize the universe. However, with the disappearance of the intellect/<em>nous</em>, and the noetic realms of reality perceivable only by it (the Divine and an angelic realms or world of Platonic Forms), Western man found himself in the curious position of being atop the Great Chain of Being. To be sure, God and heaven still lurked in the background or up in the clouds somewhere, but in terms of the knowable, perceivable, <em>intelligible </em>universe of philosophers and scientists, man was at the summit. Lovejoy records the general program of the Royal Society written by its first historian in 1667, which captures this novel <em>zeitgeist</em>:</p>
<p>Such is the dependence amongst all the orders of creatures; the animate, the sensitive, the rational, the natural, the artificial; that the apprehension of one of them is a good step towards the understanding of the rest. And this is the highest pitch of human reason: to follow all the links of this chain till all their secrets are open to our mind and their works advanc’d or imitated by our hands. This is truly to command the world; to rank all the varieties and degrees of things so orderly upon one another; that standing on the top of them, we may perfectly behold all that are below, and make them all serviceable to the quiet and peace and plenty of Man’s life.28</p>
<p>Here the “highest pitch” of human thought is not the contemplation of angelic forms or the Divine Essence above, but the external exploration and exploitation of all that lies below. It is not coincidental therefore, that this transition from inward, spiritual contemplation to outward, physical investigation and exploration coincided with the European Age of Exploration.</p>
<p>Backtracking a bit, this increase in interest in the physical world seems to have had its origins in the late<img class="wp-image-735 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Great_Chain_of_Being_2-206x300.png" alt="great_chain_of_being_2" width="353" height="514" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Great_Chain_of_Being_2-206x300.png 206w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Great_Chain_of_Being_2-185x270.png 185w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Great_Chain_of_Being_2.png 525w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /> 13th century and this was unfortunately combined with the hardening of Catholic philosophical dogma, so that many natural philosophers who attempted to systematically observe the natural world found themselves on the wrong side of the official dogma and victims of a long and often painful Inquisition process. More relevant to the topic at hand however, is the effect that Western man’s ascent to the top of the Chain of Being had for his views of the physical world in general, and the physical beauty of bodies in particular.</p>
<p>With the gradual disappearance of the intellect from Western discourse in the early Modern Period/ Renaissance (1300s-1600s), the immaterial became more and more immaterial, and partly in reaction to Medieval Scholasticism’s neglect and/or denigration of the physical world in general and the body in particular, this period saw the revival of the Greco-Roman cult of the body, partly in conjunction with the trend of increased interest in the material world, and strongly motivated by the Renaissance’s self- conscious re-interpretation or revival of classical Greek and Roman heritage.</p>
<p>The this-worldly humanist art of this period epitomized by Giotto, Da Vinci and Raphael in its early phases (1300-1500-the Early and High Renaissance), and Michelangelo, El Greco, and Rembrandt in its later phases (1500-1700-the Mannerist an Baroque period) and finally culminating in the neoclassical movement of the mid-18th epitomized by David and Ingres, stands in sharp contrast to the other-worldly and iconic medieval art which proceeded it, and demonstrates this newfound interest in and even worship of the human form. The religious paintings of these artists also foretell and demonstrate the philosophical shift from man being made the image of God to God literally being created in the image of man in works such as the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>This movement culminated in the Enlightenment wherein God was replaced by universal reason   or man’s own rational faculty, and contemplation of the angelic and Divine beauties was replaced by contemplation of physical beauty, particularly the beauty of the human form. It is significant that it was Western Man who seated himself atop of the Chain of Being, because as he replaced God, <em>his image, </em>both physical and mental, replaced the <em>imago Dei </em>as the discriminating factor determining classification on the cosmic hierarchy. Thus, the overall trend can be described as one in which the Intellect is replaced or eclipsed by the rational faculty, God is replaced by Universal Reason or the being in possession of   it, and the world of the forms or angels is eclipsed by the world of physical form, particularly human physical form.</p>
<p>Thus the elaborate angelologies of medieval Europe were replaced by the elaborate racial hierarchies of the 18th and 19th centuries. Whereas in the Middle Ages, humanity was judged by participation in or proximity to a transcendent spiritual, Divine ideal (Christ or God), the secularization process of the early Modern Period and the Enlightenment resulted in humanity being judged by proximity to the immanent ideal of rational, enlightened European man. The elevation of man to the top rung of the Chain of Being (or alternatively, his elimination of all that stood above him) is the philosophical foundation of the modern anthropocentric perspective, in which rational man, in and of himself, is the measure of all things, and an end unto himself.</p>
<p>Seminal scholar of Islamic Studies and Historian of Science Seyyed Hossein Nasr designates this seismic shift in the image of man as the transformation from “pontifical man” or man as bridge between heaven and earth (as evidenced by his central place on the Chain of Being), to “Promethean man,” man as a defiant rebel against heaven who seeks to make the world in his own image.29</p>
<p>Having summarized this transition from the perspective of man being created in the image of God to God being created in the image of man, and highlighted some important theoretical conclusions and corollaries, I will now turn to the shift from traditional ethnocentrism to modern racism in late Medieval and early Modern Europe, referring back to this section as necessary to illuminate the relationship between the development of modern racism and the rise of the anthropocentric position described above.</p>

His work examines the postcolonial, colonial, and precolonial Islamic and indigenous religious traditions of West Africa, seeking to understand the philosophical dimensions of these traditions by approaching them and their proponents not merely as sources of ethnographic or historical data, but rather as distinct intellectual traditions and thinkers, and even as sources of theory and possible inspirations for methods of scholarship in the humanities and social sciences.  Oludamini is also working on an online database of West African Sufi Poetry and, along with Ayodeji Ogunnaike, is working on a similar database for the Odu Ifa (the sacred orature of Ifa).  He is a graduate of Harvard College and earned his PhD from Harvard University&#8217;s Department of African and African American Studies. </em></p>

<p>5 These three features are commonly found in definitions of man in religious intellectual traditions ranging from the Islamic to the Hindu to the Taoist/Neo-Confucian. See Seyyed Hossein Nasr’s “Who is Man? The Perennial Answer of Islam,” in Needleman (ed.) <em>The Sword of Gnosis</em>, 203-17, and the chapter “Man as Microcosm” in Toshiko Izutsu’s <em>Sufism and Taoism</em>.</p>

<p>7 Lovejoy, <em>The Great Chain of Being</em>.</p>
<p>8 It should be noted, however that Aristotle himself rejected such an idea, pointing out that a creature which may be superior to another in respect of one characteristic, can be considered inferior to it in respect to another characteristic, and thus he did not advance any single exclusive scheme of classification, but rather several different schemes of classification and hierarchy depending on the characteristic in See Lovejoy, <em>The Great Chain of Being</em>, 56.</p>
<p>9 Plotinus, <em>Enneads V, 2</em>, 1-2.</p>
<p>10 Ibid.</p>
<p>11 Sometimes Plotinus adds a further <em>hypostasis</em>, <em>phusis</em> or nature, as the lowest projection of soul and the dim consciousness within plants, between soul and the sensible world.</p>
<p>12 Ibid.</p>
<p>13 Lovejoy, <em>The Great Chain of Being</em>, 63.</p>
<p>14 It is important to note the “types” of men discussed in Plato and Aristotle have little to do with race or ethnicity, and much more to do with natural These types are outlined in Plato’s <em>Republic </em>ranging from the philosopher-kings to the men who are driven by their baser, animal instincts. Although Aristotle seems to draw some connections between barbarian nature and the base or slave nature in his Politics, he explicitly mitigates this tendency, writing, “for it must be admitted that some are slaves everywhere, others nowhere” <em>Politics I </em>6.</p>
<p>15 Plotinus, <em>Enneads </em>III, 2.9.</p>
<p>16 Psalm 8:5.</p>
<p>17 Lovejoy, <em>The Great Chain of Being</em>, 64.</p>
<p>18 This perspective, an extension of the supra-rational (<em>nous</em>/<em>noiea</em>) rational, discursive (<em>logos</em>/<em>dianoia</em>) soul/knowledge divide of Plato, was later fused with the vegetative, animal, and rational soul-levels of Aristotle by Islamic philosophers to produce a neo-Platonic Aristotelian synthesis upon which the Scholastics such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus based their work.</p>
<p>19 Indeed Ibn Rushdwasdeeply concernedwiththereconciliationof reasonandrevelation. See G. Durand’s <em>On The Disfiguration of the Image of Man in the Wes</em>t for an argument linking his influence with the increased rationalism of late Medieval thought.</p>
<p>20 Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologicae</em> I.93.6.</p>
<p>21 Ibid.</p>
<p>22 Burke, “The spread of Italian humanism,” 2.</p>
<p>23 Durand, <em>On the Disfiguration of the Image of Man in the West</em>.</p>
<p>24 For a more thorough description of this transformation see Durand, <em>On the Disfiguration of the Image of Man the West</em> and Nasr <em>Religion and the Order of Nature</em>. Furthermore, the error of translating <em>nous</em>/<em>intellectus</em> as rational faculty or mind that arose during the late Renaissance became endemic throughout the modern period as modern thinkers read their own rationalist tendencies into classical authors, see Hadot, <em>What is Ancient Philosophy</em>?.</p>
<p>25 Marsilio Ficino, Pico di Mirandella, Giordano Bruno, and Angelus Silesius and Paracelsus in Northern Europe, and other mystics were notable for their revival or continued adherence to the neo-Platonic concept of a <em>nous</em> at once transcendent and immanent.</p>
<p>26 Thus whole groups of men came to be judged and ranked by their apparent rationality or lack thereof, as we will see when we turn to the Enlightenment’s version of the Great Chain of Being.</p>
