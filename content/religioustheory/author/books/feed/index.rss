Columbia University Press, 2016. 520 pages. ISBN 9780231178761</strong></p>
<p>Illustrating the constrictions of the received metaphysical legacy, the intimate as a universal seeks a space between the typical contrasts of the notion of particulars and universals, or the immanent and transcendent.</p>
<p>Desmond attempts to move beyond the forever philosophical conversation of those relations. <em>Being </em>is placed as a vested ontological relation that is greater than a link between individuals within the public sphere, while arriving at its truest articulation in and as an agapic communal posture. This relationality may not appear as a unique claim per se, but it is robust as an anthological approach preserving the whole whilst sustaining a tangible place for the individual in their irreducibly intimate <em>and </em>universal reality, i.e., what Desmond interprets as a shared porosity of being.</p>
<p>The proposal is a means to not fall prey to accepted binaries or to fashion the concrete without dismantling the universal whole which otherwise results in the negating of a shared community. In this regard, it gives voice to the particular over what he deems as the Aristotelian stifling of immanence or the nominalistic collection of particulars which in his view are found wanting in their communal universal expression. This preserves what is proper to each and the other, and steers clear of that void of universality that often absorbs the individual into the relational.</p>
<p>Then in his schema the defective dualistic Platonic ideas and those wholly transcendent idealic universals are positioned against the intimate universal which recognizes concrete individuation and abstract universality not just as poles, but allies which can permeate what they contain as brackets. The intimate universal seeks that which is “closest to the fecund matrix of significance in relation to what is often called [the] sense of the whole [understood] as our being in the between” (7). Desmond sets out to retain a transcendence without the ‘putting out into the open’ of universality and to concretely maintain an imminent intimacy by escaping the ‘pitching of the tents’ in any particularity.</p>
<p>It is specifically this ‘space between’ that Desmond has been sculpting throughout his career, particularly the being in between which is that ‘sense of the whole’. This publication is a continuation of that effort. Emerging from the process is the immanent being, never <em>opposed </em>to the transcendent, encapsulating both poles that share a Hegelian dialectical whole. The metaxological then, a now familiar neologism that is other-related by necessity, avoids the taint of a Platonic duality of differentness.</p>
<p>In this regard, porosity offers a unity of the same whole and a doubling of interiority results in a universal that is concurrently wholly intimate. Consider that without such mediation the “dictatorial thinking [of] the superimposition of the universal on the particular” (119) would be without power to contend rightly with the <em>merely </em>private unrepeatable singulars. This error overcome by Desmond, reveals the hidden “space of open porosity that is at the heart of living communicability” (133) as an intimate <em>being in-between</em>, perhaps against the rationalists’ zeitgeist, but best buoyed in a religious expression.</p>
<p><em>The Intimate Universal </em>is part of the “Insurrections: Critical Studies in Religion, Politics, and Culture” series from Columbia University Press, edited by Žižek, Crockett, Davis, and Robbins. Realizing the capacity of religion to both obscure and disentangle elements of culture and politics, this work furthers that effort. This present composition of Desmond is set off in two nearly equal length sections under the headings of “Exoteric Reflections” and “Systematic Thoughts,” with parallels in each mirroring the title ideas of religion, art, philosophy, and politics with the agapic, aesthetic, erotic, and idiotic respectively.</p>
<p>In the beginning section, the intimate universal is determined in relation to religion, in terms of what he states as the cosmopolis and the ghetto as two contrasting, but not competing orientations. Following is the chapter on art and how it communicates neither imitation or self-creation, and with the third element of this section he seeks a sense of ‘doing justice’ that neither collapses into practice or to theory. With the final chapter of the first section, the metaphysics necessary for the self ‘to be’ a participation with the intimate universal stands against both disordered servility and the tyranny of sovereignty. Then, in the concluding half of the work on “Systematic Thoughts,” the ontological dimensions offer an emphasis turning to both <em>being </em>and <em>human</em>, which in lieu of those previously listed anthropological elements, embraces a more systematic than reflective analysis.</p>
<p>There is a vast span to Desmond’s project, so it is admittingly a strain to do justice to the near five-hundred-page argument in this short review, but the hope here is to offer a digestible approach while staying true to the flavor of the overall presentation. With that hope, a correlative comparison of each anthropological element across both sections may offer an intriguing taste to his effort while acknowledging the eisegetic risk of moving beyond the author’s intent. It is best to take into account that the reality these constitutive elements of the human person express lack compelling force if presumed to be mutually exclusive ideas.</p>
<p>With that proviso, in the first pairing concerning politics and the idiotic, Desmond sees the latter as a matter of the <em>self </em>keeping to itself. It is presented as an intimate affirmation of being arising “to gesture toward a strange universality that also, strangely, is not strange” (207), but a manifesting of that which is already present yet unawakened. This ‘idiot wisdom’ viewed in the political vein offers a “metaxological otherness [which] discerns in the very ontological robustness of immanent otherness and original communication of an even more radical otherness” (167).</p>
<p>As the in-between which one never left, this could be undone by an imposition of value on the other, or a ‘self-affirming will to be’ where the convergence of the intimate and universal is thwarted. Applied to the political realm, it is well known that revolutions if resting merely on an aversion to the status quo, tend to result in nothing more than a Nietzschean power reversal. So, where one ‘collective will’ rises above the other, a varietal host of intermediating elements sink from the whole; the family, academic associations, and agapeic communities among them, which then shrink from the political space, and lapse into webs of utility yielding to the replacing power. In opposition to such consequence, the intimate universal is both a self and a re-affirmation of being wherein the subversion or undoing of the other is not borne out.</p>
<p>In terms of philosophy, ‘doing justice’ for Desmond is prior to any theory or practice. He speaks of this under the guise of philosophical agendas, which even when acknowledged remain top-down and by their nature, dictatorial over the particular. Yet there is in his philosophy a crucial anthropological foundation requiring <em>more </em>than man; an Absolute perhaps even unrecognized or unnamed. Following this thought, if man were his own measure then politics would eclipse the ‘something more’ and mankind would become the measure of itself as some Protagorean paradox.</p>
<p>Here porosity is applied to the political in preserving from the human person the remoteness of the universal (the Absolute one wonders?) and the irrelevancy of the close-up relevance in a way that “doing justice is something intermediate for humans [where] before all agendas there is something received” (126). Add to this political power the erotic once freed from its Freudian drive, exposes a sovereignty afoot. This <em>eros</em>, rescued from the counterfeit, is not unlike the wooing of another for Desmond, which he finds proximate to the <em>passio essendi</em>. With the political others, this remains “faithful to the porosity of love, waiting in ‘patient readiness’ for the surprise of the other, the gift of the secret beloved” (235) and a condition of possibility. This provides an ample self-determinacy, though resting in theory, remaining unrealized and outside of justice without a relational other.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the aesthetic has something to say and not unlike the political element, it is community oriented. Comparable to the political other it possesses a readiness in patience to receive. Art retains that power to circumvent a closed immanence via its communitive yet confusing nature. Desmond calls this confusion “a generative <em>con-fusio</em>—not the vanishing of difference but the fusion with, fluency with, the selves and the others” (61), and comparably connects the aesthetic to the sensible human body and the earth; notice how ‘human’ and ‘earth’ cannot be poles.</p>
<p>Here, <em>being </em>is in a surplus-determinacy. And like the magnificence of art and its ability to ‘stop one’ in their tracks and force the gaze, in this ‘imaginative selving’ of sensitivity “the birth of surprise comes in, comes over a process of self-determination…[as] something other eventuates in this birth” (259). The imaginative aspect of the aesthetic forwards a porosity to the other and a space of hospitality forms as each are birthed with (<em>ruah</em>), as the whole exceeds the particulars.</p>
<p>Finally concerning agapeic religion, though presented here last Desmond thought it primary as “being religious carries something of the richest resonance of the intimate universal” (23) and therefore for him it spearheads the text; for this review that prominence is confirmed by placing it as the capstone. He situates the universals in this regard between an imminent self-regarding holism and a theoretical groundless imposition of human thinking that is otherwise simply ‘out there’ by projection. Desmond claims it as impossible otherwise to establish apart from the purview of a personal God where “religion is neither for merely privatized subjectivities nor for objectivized generalities” (42) —he sees no parallel appearance or necessity for that matter in the philosophical concern for this distinct strain of agape where one does not bind (<em>re-ligare</em>) the divine and human to form community.</p>
<p>Yet even in the Augustinian dual cities of man and God, the condition of the between is not clear as each ‘city’ is part of each, and to usurp one over the other results either in idolatry or bondage. He deduces that “the consummation of the intimate universal [is] the religious <em>kononia</em>…[where] gifted by a surplus generosity, ultimate in itself and calling human beings to imitate and enact this generosity in finite life” (416-17) this mutual porosity surfaces as the engendering social bond.</p>
<p>In closing, it is noteworthy to appreciate that in the front matter of <em>The Intimate Universal</em>, Desmond includes as an epigraph the passage from the Gospel of Matthew 13:51-52, which reads, “’Have you understood all this?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ And he said to them, ‘Well, then, every scribe who becomes a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out from his storeroom things both new and old.’” Desmond stayed close to that parable.</p>

Haar Farris (Eds.), <em>Speculation, Heresy, and Gnosis in Contemporary Philosophy of Religion: The Enigmatic Absolute</em>. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2016. 299 pages. ISBN: 9781786601414</strong></p>
<p>The volume edited by Ramey and Haar Farris is a compendium of, for the most part, high theory experimental writings. The volume collects reworked papers from a 2012 conference called “Thinking the Absolute: Speculation, Philosophy, and the End of Religion” held at Liverpool Hope University, and as the very first volume of a new Rowman and Littlefield series titled Reframing Continental Philosophy of Religion and edited by Steven Shakespeare and Duane Williams (both of Liverpool Hope University). This collection contributes to the field of philosophy of religion generally, where multitudes of scholars raise hand, but few embrace a programmatic commitment to realism that is neither anti-religious nor autistically scientific.</p>
<p>Finding and situating itself in the contemporary condition of religion <em>and</em> science, this book will serve scholars and readers familiar with and working in comparative philosophy and religion, theology and politics, as well as experts in Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Islamic philosophy, mysticism, biblical scholarship and canonicity, and crossovers between science, poetry and religion as they are conjugated in philosophy, theology and arts department leaning to both the experimental and the experiential. The volume will be of particular interest to those belonging to the aforementioned fields and who have at the same time followed in the footsteps of both Meillassoux and Laruelle and, respectively, speculative/new realisms and materialisms and non-philosophy as they, in turn, conjugate with religious studies.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, <em>Speculation, Heresy, and Gnosis in Contemporary Philosophy of Religion: The Enigmatic Absolute </em>can be read as attempting to address the following problem, which is never spelled out in its entirety: Is the Absolute ineffable? The volume is held together more by a shared <em>poiesis</em> rigor than rigorous <em>scientia</em>. Yet, despite this infrastructural asymmetry, few of the contributions fail to address the problem of ineffability. It is because of this focus that Ramey and Haar Farris’s work should be praised for keeping an editorial horizon that, despite few vacillating exceptions, is often an exception in the world of edited thematic volumes.</p>
<p>The experimental quality of the volume is not going to be the object of the present review &#8211; not because it does not deserve attention, but because it is the experiential dimension of the book’s commitment that looms large and strikes right in the heart of what would usually be described merely as “(continental) philosophy of religion.” Because of its programmatic commitment to post-Kantian realism(s), the authors gathered here all address in implicit and explicit ways what is wrong (and rarely right) with the continental notion of ineffability.</p>
<p>The problem of ineffability is often hailed as the axis of power for contemporary continental thought and, to varying degrees, continental philosophies of religion. In continental circles, ineffability has historically served to debilitate the analysis of the reality of any object under the scrutiny of speculation and/or scientific rigor. (“Speculation” is nothing but the Hegelian overlapping of being and thought. What the use of this term disputes since the anti-correlationist thesis was launched is the status of contingency.) Because most religious theory and scholarship is already hellbent on the implied ineffability of God’s name, doing away with the ineffable could come as a somewhat shocking move. This is even more true in continental philosophy (of religion or not, atheistic or not), as the Jewish-French post-War conjugations of Heidegger also rehash on the never-ending business of ineffability every time the object of analysis (and the result of the analysis thereof) is to the dislike of the writer.</p>
<p>In scholarly religious context proper, the veneer of open mysticism, added to the one already imbuing from within the phenomenological certainties of noumenalism, makes the worst of scenarios for the actual thinking – and knowing &#8211; of categories such as the Absolute. As a result, saying that the latter is “enigmatic” bears no importance whatsoever. The qualifier “enigmatic” is then either tautological or hyper-determined.</p>
<p>The enigmatic quality is here taken seriously, as one which is researchable. Which brings us to the “experiential.” By “experiential” I mean that the book generally stipulates that the spiritual experience of/in this world is based not on mere spiritual encounters with the disembodied and the unknowable, but on the latter’s observability within the limits of rational embodiment. So, taken at face value, Meillassoux’s “divine inexistence” is deified and pursued in much of the texts published here.</p>
<p>There is a “Meillassoux in action” overtone here, which is generally lost the more one moves away from Part I, where the editorial horizon is most saturated. In the editors’ Introduction (especially pp. 1-3), and following Meillassoux’s critique of philosophies of finitude/access, it is claimed that, in order to organize meaningfully “the great outdoors,” the absolute contingency of both being and thought has to be acknowledged, as the building blocs of speculation. That the “absolute can be <em>whatever</em>” is a consequence of taking Meillassoux to heart. This position weaponizes the editors with a <em>raison d’être</em> regarding an operative notion of the Absolute: only the “reality of uncertainty” is absolute.</p>
<p>Building on such a position, the editors’ ambition is to offer intersections of such an Absolute in the impasses of post-Kantianism, stating that what is missing in both Meillassoux and phenomenology, deconstruction, etc., is “the fact that non-ordinary, mystical, or magical states of consciousness … <em>neither</em> have clear names <em>nor</em> are unnameable, but are rather <em>sites of the generation of new names</em>…” (3).</p>
<p>To explore these sites, the book is divided in four parts. The focus on the reality of, and achieving the Absolute, is most pronounced in Part I: Speculations (I): Futures of the Absolute, in the chapters of Daniel Whistler and Mark Mason and Michael O’Rourke. The first pedantically unearths performative contradictions within Meillassoux’s work to suggest that he too is inebriated by the finitude of language and in effect abandons the Real, while the latter offers a more or less emphatic engagement with Meillassoux in trying to make him work with Caputo on the notion of the messiah.</p>
<p>Matt Lee and Jesse Hock both inspect aspects of extraneous and mystical knowledge against the background of strong correlationsim, the first by theorizing “sorcery” as alien knowledge, and the latter by going back to the Lucretius via Deleuze and the notion of the “broken line.” Part I generally orbits around the key problem of “pragmatics” and how it can enact fundamentally the nameability of contingent realities in light of Meillassoux’s work.</p>
<p>Part II: Speculations (II): Visionary Conditions continues some lines of work from Part I, such as Juan Salzano’s chapter on the “nebular,” Erin Yerby’s work on witchcraft and embodied imagery, and Erik Davis’ chapter on the “inner flesh” in Henry. But those texts go further than metapositional interpretations of critiquing finitude and thus further away from Meillassouxian presuppositions of enacting the absolute and the mystical, confined as they are by, precisely, finding “new names.”</p>
<p>Matthew S. Haar Farris and Steven Shakespeare’s chapters, respectively on theurgy as a contemporary methodology of surveying the spiritual, and on chaos magick as a primer of Kirkegaard’s understanding of chaos, gradually introduce the reader, with their examples of varied scholarly sources, to Part III: Heresy: Experiments, where influences such as Henry’s phenomenology of salvation and Derrida’s deconstruction of the traces grow dim. Part II offers “visions” into the enigmatic absolute in as much as it enacts certain exactitudes in the spirit of Meillassoux’s hyper-chaos but does not follow any specific programmatist steps.</p>
<p>Thus Part III, with its emphasis on Heresy, continues the topic of chaos from the preceding two chapters, in the work of Sam Webster on the Hermetic Order and theurgy, which is a very useful blending of topics that have already been rehearsed in previous chapters and puts a strong emphasis on ritual and its role for spirituality in the context of philosophy of religion today. This chapter in particular is a good example of defying the axiomatic of ineffability by the specific instance of theurgic ritual practice (although, as could be rightly objected, <em>theurgia</em> is, to use Laruelle’s term, not sufficiently <em>philosophically impoverished</em>). The same is true to some extent about Clark Roth’s chapter on sex magic, but Part III zooms out of this emphasis on ritual with the work of Rocco Gangle and ná Khar Elliff-ce.</p>
<p>These last three chapters are specimens of experiments with philosophy of religion and spirituality, although not necessarily immersed in the experiential. Especially Gangle’s essay on the generic, which amounts to a crossover between treatise, citational map, and poetry guide, embodies the Laruellian aversion to “examples” despite the ones already in use. This is not the case in Elliff-ce’s text, where poetry is put to decisional use. Despite the bold English and the acute parallels drawn between authors (Artaud, Perlonger, Lezama Lima), this is perhaps the least accessible text in this volume and not for reasons of experimentality: sometimes the best of editors can be failed by the author’s language capacity.</p>
<p>Jason Smick’s chapter should be singled out for its scholarly perseverance to unveil the importance of its object, Pierre Hadot’s work, and his importance for 20<sup>th</sup> century continental philosophies of embodiment, and implicitly Foucaultianism. It is a refreshing reminder that experiment and scholarly work make a good couple when the right alchemical balance of prose and form is found. The present writer failed to see this blending in Elliff-ca’s chapter despite the promising potential of revealing how poetics/poetry can introduce the modern self to “engagement” pre- or post-discursively.</p>
<p>Part IV: Gnosis: Creatures of Saying and Unsaying, which, as its title reveals, offers experiments in the problem of ineffability via divergent notions of personal/salvific knowledge, both radicalizes the connection to embodiment that preoccupies Parts II and III and is the closest to Laruellian non-philosophy. Beatrice Marovich’s work in many ways speaks to the one of Lee and Salzano in that it intimates a connection between neoanimism and spirituality. Her chapter, despite repeating some long-established truisms of Timaean cosmology, is a good rejoinder that entangles in itself many of the preoccupations present in this volume, specifically with respect to the importance of non-human knowledge/epistemology and the end of philosophies of access/finitude &#8211; with the usual Plato culprit.</p>
<p>The next three texts in Part IV (by Daniel Colucciello Barber, Anthony Paul Smith and Alex Dubilet) are in effect a dossier of non-philosophical experiments in the domain of (continental) religious theory. Barber’s philosophical prose is inimitably lucid and deserves special mention: it is scholarly rigid with a rich and masterful phrase. By offering a negative conception of the Absolute, by diagnosing this world as separate from its gnosis, he suggests that only an undetermined and “unpossessed” type of knowledge can separate gnosis from the ways of Christianity and its quasi-religious heir of secularism. There are docetic overtones here, subtly masquerading in a scholarly fashion, giving way to a decreationist Gnosticism. By claiming that gnosis affirms unpossessed knowledge, Barber reintroduces both the problem of the eternity of the world in a continental key and contributes to the thesis that philosophy entails subordination and, by extension, capitalism as a form of organized sociality.</p>
<p>It is this approximation that is often dear to those readers of Laruelle prone to his mystical writings, but so is true of the Laruellian crypto-gnosis which pervades Smith’s and Dubilet’s chapters. Smith too addresses the problem of separation between world and gnosis (of creation and un/de/creation, or, of sayable and unsayable) without devolving to a pronounced political argument. He inspects the Ismaili notion of <em>taqqyia</em> (dissimulation), which itself has had a political instrumentalization, but takes its history away from that political context to generalize it and makes an argument about the undetermined relation between subjectivity and grammar, extending to the practice of translation, or, to translation as a failed salvation and response to separation, rendering the whole experience as “humiliation.” His example plays with a motif similar to that of Barber: translation is not unlike gnosis in that it dissimulates the world/the real in order to respond to the already false world of becoming.</p>
<p>Smith’s chapter, however, is probably as close as it gets to a rendition of ineffability that borders with the acceptable for anti-correlationist agendas. Dubilet looks at Eckhart to make an argument that his preaching lies in the interstitial spaces between philosophy and theology. His account is closer to a Deleuzian argument about the immanence of God but without the vitalist overtones traditionally associated with late Deleuizian readings. Dubilet’s argument serves the purpose of de-scripturalizing immanence by making a Deleuzo-Laruellian case for the immanence of interpretation and experimentation within the <em>word</em> of God. This argument nicely circles back to the initial promise of “new names,” without having to necessarily name them.</p>
<p>The last two essays by Eugene Thacker and Nicola Masciandaro close the book as sort of prolonged post scripts. Thacker’s essay on cosmic pessimism, here republished in a refined version, is a Pascal-esque experiment in saying the unsayable about the weight of gnostic impasses with creation. Thacker’s witty approach achieves the odd victory of ridiculing its own object of speculation. The major conclusion drawn is that the absolute quality of pessimism is its own failure to become what it wants to be, a certain system of reflecting/speculating on the created world. In this regard, pessimism is indeed a failed philosophy and thus capitalism (although Thacker is not concerned with this problem, his conclusion works nicely with the Laruellian doublet). Masciandaro’s essay is less comic and more cosmic, pressing as it does on the common work of philosophy, speculation and the Absolute.</p>
<p>Brimming with imperatives, exhortations, and deixis, this essay closes the present volume by taking as its cornerstone the <em>dynamis</em> of stupidity in philosophy itself. Thus, the last two texts of this volume dissimulate philosophy as a grandiose and self-styled failure of itself – without the pretension of political lessons learned but inviting to relaunch the Absolute as stupidly bypassed.</p>
<p>Although, taken together, the Introduction and the four parts of this volume work together in a somewhat successful balance of religion, science, poetry and their tensions and intensions, it is at times difficult to see the volume as a univocal contribution to the same commitment. In the publishing business of conference papers, it is generally difficult (although not impossible) to make all participants contribute to the same single background problem that has conceptualized the event to begin with.</p>
<p>In the present case, despite the often untamed and, I would surmise, unwanted quality of plurivocity, the book suffers more from the differing research quality of the texts collected than the differential commitment to the same goal. Transforming a conference into a coherent printed body is always a Herculean labour and where Hercules has suffered the most here is in the research dimension: with the exception of Part I, Parts II to IV offer primers of excellent rigorous research, on the one hand, and research notes-meets-essay, on the other. For example, it is difficult to read, in Part III, Gangle and Elliff-ce, or, in Part IV, Smith and Thacker, as bearing the same scholarly effort and brunt, despite the weight of originality, and sometimes because of it.</p>
<p>As an inaugural volume of a new book series, the book can justifiably suffer from a scholarly disbalance among its contributions and, over more, the business model of conference papers <em>perhaps</em> should not mean that all texts must meet the same standards. There is enough ambivalence in the Introduction that already allows space for such disbalance; furthermore, the latter is often what cracks open creativity in severely conservative fields. Finding an excuse for the disbalance is, in short, possible. Whether the disbalance is justified is, in the opinion of the present writer, to the judgement of the experiential reader. And she does not need to be experimental in order to judge.</p>
<p>In short, it seems the conference has been more experimental than the resulting volume, but the volume is less scholarly than the conference organizers and editors might have wanted it to be. In light of the specific and new vistas here, this result could be justified. However, it casts some doubt on the overall result and its capacity to speak by naming the new names of the Absolute, however enigmatic, undetermined, or real it is.</p>
<p>Because this volume’s orientation is a refreshing and bold move against the ontological depredations of ineffability, imposed as they are onto every schema of perceiving the lugubrious world of creation, and specifically the spiritual world, one would righty assume it is something of a deliberately enigmatic compendium. This would be wrong not because the “enigmatic” does not work well with the “experimental,” but because failing to meet the standard of glorifying ineffability rights a wrong in continental philosophy proper.</p>
<p>On this account, any writing that does not comply with the phenomenological edifice and the bricks of its ineffable phenomena is neither “continental” nor “religious,” let alone “spiritual.” Thus, Ramey and Haar Farris offer not an enigmatic collection of psychic oddities trying to circumvent its own object of investigation (the Absolute), but a collection that would appear enigmatic only to those whose God (scientific, religious, poetic) is ineffability itself.</p>

New York: Columbia University Press, 2018. ISBN 9780231179041</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><b> Hardback. 321 pages.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Newberg’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neurotheology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a book of questions: why are some people religious and others not? Does religion have an impact on health and well-being? What is the difference between religion and spirituality? Can religious and spiritual thought be localized to one hemisphere of the brain? What can brain imaging tell us about mystical experiences? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his opening paragraph, Newberg wonders if we can trace a path toward “novel insights into the nature of our world and the nature of reality.” [1]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the essential question underlying all the others, “How do we know what is really real?” Later, he calls this the overarching goal of neurotheology, “exploring the nature of reality and how humans perceive that reality.” [2]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what is neurotheology?</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2396" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2396" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2396" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/611992272-612x612-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/611992272-612x612-300x200.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/611992272-612x612.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2396" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Theology is simply that part of religion that requires brains.&#8221; &#8211; GK Chesterton</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newberg describes this book as an “attempt at a reasonably thorough, and user-friendly, tour of neurotheology as it currently stands.” [3]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He describes neurotheology as carving out an “integrated approach to the nature of the human person by combining the physical and the spiritual,” i.e. an integrated approach to brain science and the broadest possible conception of spirituality. [4]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This approach is deeply interdisciplinary. Such an approach mirrors how humanity itself deals with the world, writes Newberg. [5]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This raises the question of the relationship between religion and science. They are described as the two “primary forces” in human history and Newberg is thoughtful about the possibility of bringing these forces together to forge a more holistic understanding of humanity. When observing that both science and religion are products of the human brain, for instance, he carefully notes this is not a reductionist position. “Even if there is a God that exists outside of the brain,” the brain enables belief and creates meaning. [6]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-2398 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pope_neuroscience-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="225" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pope_neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pope_neuroscience-687x455.jpg 687w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pope_neuroscience.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" />In his third chapter on “Neuroscience and Neurotheology,” Newberg provides a short and accessible overview of brain structure and function in relationship with religion and spirituality. In a fourth chapter asking, “What is Religion from a Neurotheological Perspective?,” he provides an excellent overview of prior attempts at defining “religion” and follows this immediately with a chapter attempting to define and distinguish “spirituality.” Among these efforts are scientific attempts to operationalize categories for research and those who have found the search for a definition of “religion” intractable may find this approach helpful. This is one of the key strengths of the book. Newberg uses big ideas as a starting point in a movement toward increasingly precise terminology and the careful construction of potentially answerable questions. Which is to say, questions that are potentially answerable by future research in neurotheology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter Six discusses the relationship between religion and evolution with characteristic nuance. Newberg cites prior work with Eugene d’Aquili where they argue religion supports two fundamental brain processes: self-maintenance and self-transcendence. Self-maintenance refers to survival; perhaps religion makes a contribution to physical and mental health. Self-transcendence is the capacity to strive for something greater than ourselves; perhaps religion contributes to our drive for social cohesion. Newberg is aware that some writers have tried to use evolution and science generally to denigrate religion or explain it away. He is adept at presenting potentially theistic and non-theistic perspectives on equal footing. This sensitivity is especially helpful in his subsequent two chapters dealing with the psychology of religion and brain pathology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interesting question of whether Saul’s Damascene conversion could be physically correlated with a temporal lobe seizure is raised. [7]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Future research in drug-induced religious experiences is also discussed, but the issue seems so directly on point that I wished for more than a four-page treatment. Most importantly, Newberg again demonstrates his concern for careful language by concluding with consideration of how we discern between “’normal’ or ‘abnormal’ spirituality or religiousness . . . in relation to a pathological brain state.” [8]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an anthropological turn, chapters nine and ten deal with how myths and rituals interact with the brain and body. Can myths be connected to particular regions of the brain? Perhaps the limbic system for strong emotional content or the frontal lobes for executive function? Newberg suggests these questions are answerable through careful research design and fMRI. Concerning ritual, he offers the compelling possibility that we might be able to use scientific measures to determine the intensity of brain response in comparative studies of different religious traditions and techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2397 alignleft" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Neurons-in-the-Cosmos-771x433-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Neurons-in-the-Cosmos-771x433-300x168.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Neurons-in-the-Cosmos-771x433-768x431.jpg 768w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Neurons-in-the-Cosmos-771x433.jpg 771w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Newberg also argues that the myth-ritual relationship is a question of unity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myths “present a problem as a pair of opposites to be resolved” and rituals “typically produce powerful unitary experiences,” potentially resolving the mythic dilemma.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In mystical practices, this resolution may rise to the level of a total union of self with other, or self with God. In the fourteenth chapter, a closer look at mystical experiences wonders if they might help us resolve the “fundamental problem of escaping our brain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a neurotheological framework allowing us to associate physical brain states with subjective mystical experiences, Newberg believes we can achieve an epistemological breakthrough. While the significance of this is difficult to overstate, it is equally difficult to grapple with what such a breakthrough might look like. Newberg himself compares it to unified field theory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book proselytizes for neurotheology. In every chapter, provocative and potentially world-changing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">questions are raised and it seems neurotheology may lead to answers. This makes for exciting reading but the book works best as a broad overview. It is exactly what it promises to be in its introduction—a passionate and optimistic tour of an emerging field. For this reason, it is difficult to fault the book for a lack of depth in some places but it could stand to be a little more down to earth. An honest look at the technical challenges involved with using different kinds of brain scans to study religion and spirituality is a welcome dose of realism in chapter eleven, for instance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neurotheology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a fine introduction to the field and it will make an excellent supplement to introductory and methods courses in the study of religion. This is due in part to Newberg’s knowledgeable and nuanced treatment of the questions and terms important in theological and religious studies. His balanced and reflective approach to the relationship between science and religion is refreshing and makes his work a pleasure to read.</span></p>

Oxford, UK and New York, NY: Oxford University Press 2017. ISBN 9780190272432  Hardcover. 419 pages.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several genres of writing stereotypically intersect with the topics of medicine and religion: empirical studies of religion&#8217;s impact on various health outcomes, historical studies of the relationships between religion and medicine, and general guidebooks on being a more spiritually sensitive healthcare practitioner. Balboni and Peteet both employ and modify these traditional approaches to the topic, making this book uniquely suited for use by health care practitioners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first section explores the implications of religious belief in various medical subspecialties: pediatrics, palliative care, gynecology, and intensive care units. The gift of most of these chapters on religion in clinical specialties is that they are written by physicians practicing in the respective disciplines. Organization by clinical specialties shows what this reviewer, experienced chaplains, and most medical practitioners know: religion&#8217;s role in a clinical encounter depends on the location of the encounter and the state of the patient and family. The chapters on clinical disciplines consistently identify issues where further research is needed, extending this book’s efficacy to those considering research in such disciplines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" alignright" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQGdDgl5vA6PyXeKOp6H_f_OLGKMIm389f9Mg2Ht1NRvPf_zevy" width="170" height="278" />Treating the issues of religion as they specifically relate to various clinical specialties is not only wholistically sensitive &#8211; it is practically wise. The theological questions generated by an end of life case in pediatrics are much different than the theological questions generated by an end of life case in geriatrics. The mother of a dying six year old has different questions for God then the mother of a dying ninety six year old. The questions generated by cancer are different than the questions generated by the diagnosis of a fetus with a genetic abnormality.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book&#8217;s organization makes it especially useful for medical students as well as clinical pastoral education students. These essays cite the quantitative research on their respective specialties but do so in a way that shows religion&#8217;s relevance for those not versed in the intricacies of quantitative research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After examining the role of religion in various clinical specialties, the book moves on the treat other aspects of the interaction between religion and medicine. Leading scholars such as Gary Ferngren look at the role of religion and medicine in historical perspective drawing on more respective work. Brett McCarthy and Warren Kinghorn explore the role of theology in evaluating religion and health. Another chapter treats the important legal matters that govern physician-patient relationships. Taking into consideration the numerous cases that arise each year relating to healthcare matters, especially in the wake of the Hobby Lobby decision by the United States Supreme Court, it is highly possible that the legal section may soon find itself dated and in need of a new edition. The closing chapter is a meta-analysis of the field of medicine and religion by noted biostatician Tyler VanderWeele, synthesizing statistics concerning the role of religion and health across disciplines. </span></p>

width="119" height="207" />In recognizing that the there is no single abstract narrative about religion&#8217;s relationship to illness, Peteet and Balboni have given us a clinically useful book in lieu of something simply theoretical. This book is ideally suited for use by medical students and residents, as the structure of the book around clinical specialties allows for them to use it encyclopaedically as opposed to necessitating a thorough linear progression. Peteet and Balboni have made a thoughtful, useful contribution to the growing field of religion and medicine, for which we owe them our thanks. </span></p>

In that earlier book, which bore as its subtitle </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Theological Aesthetic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he sought to consider by means of phenomenology’s own principles that which phenomenology has long claimed to be impossible: namely, religious experience as given through the senses. For Manoussakis, “it is our body that allows us to be united with the divine.”<a href="#_ftn1">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1]</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This provocative claim—which runs counter to the traditional philosophical prioritizing of mind over body—makes it clear why Manoussakis’s theological aesthetic “has little to do with… that branch of philosophy that deals with the notion of beauty and fine arts” and instead derives “from [the] original Greek sense of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">aisthanomani</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: to feel by means of one’s senses.”<a href="#_ftn2">[</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="#_ftn2">2]</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A theological aesthetic is, for Manoussakis, an encounter with God made possible by our capacity to receive that which is outside or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through taste, touch, sight, and sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet if such an aesthetic is possible—that is to say if we can have a sensory, tactile experience of God—it is only because our bodies exist in time or, to put it more accurately, because time belongs to the body. Manoussakis agrees with phenomenology’s claim that consciousness both constitutes and is constituted by time, but he also insists that there can be “no consciousness that is not embodied,” no time without the body.<a href="#_ftn3">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Similarly, it would make no sense to speak of the body without time: “A body that becomes hungry”—i.e. a body that functions as body, that does what bodies do—“is a body affected by time.”<a href="#_ftn4">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> body, that hungering, lacking, limited body “that allows us to be united with the divine.” For, when God “becomes what He is not, non-God, the sarx of the incarnation,”<a href="#_ftn5">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when he ceases to be “a god who sees (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">theos</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) [and becomes] a god who touches and can be touched even to the folly of being eaten,”<a href="#_ftn6">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he opens up the possibility of receiving him through the senses: a theological aesthetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reversal of the Platonic/Neo-Platonic ascent away from the body which insists that the answer to man’s fallenness can only “be found in and effected by a descent into the bodily”<a href="#_ftn7">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is first introduced in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">God After Metaphysics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it is not until not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethics of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which Manoussakis offers an extended commentary on Augustine’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confessions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that it receives its fullest articulation. In his consideration of the phenomenology of conversion, that is the phenomenology of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">change</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Manoussakis provide us with a truly original reading of Augustine’s project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manoussakis does so by placing Augustine in dialogue with psychoanalysts such as Freud and Lacan on topics that have been psychology’s patrimony: memory, desire, and temporality. Indeed, Manoussakis himself is the first to note the remarkable resemblance that his interests bear to those of the psychoanalyst.<a href="#_ftn8">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thus, he does not hesitate to employ the language and insights offered him by theoretical psychology. Rather he takes his own advice and, writing as a phenomenologist, borrows freely from a field that he believes to be strikingly conversant with his own.<a href="#_ftn9">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9]</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ought not to be surprised, then, to find Manoussakis following in the footsteps of Augustine who adopted and adapted the best ideas that other thinkers had to offer in the service of his own philosophical pursuits. It is this ability to appropriate the insights of a wide array of perspectives that allows Manoussakis to offer an original answer to the classic philosophical problem of evil. What he calls his “phenomenological theodicy” attempts to reconcile the existence of a good God with man’s experience of evil and suffering by taking into consideration phenomenology’s insistence on the import of time.<a href="#_ftn10">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10]</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of psychological theories like Freud’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nachträglichkeit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Manoussakis argues that the movement of time precipitates an “ethical delay” which allows us to understand our lives only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after the fact</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only when the events and traumas have occurred and enough time has elapsed for us to collect our fragmentary memories into a unified story of the self. The good, he claims, can only come </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">later</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only by means of the movement of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Manoussakis, time is movement and change. It is the progression of history toward its eschatological end. But unlike Hegel’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phenomenology of the Spirit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the eschatological realization of history is not a project to be carried out by us. It is, rather, a movement that carries us—often against our will and intentions. Here, then, the ethical dimension of time to which the title of his work eludes becomes clear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For, if time is the movement from imperfection to perfection, from creation to eschaton, if evil is, what Manoussakis calls, “a moment in the temporalized unfolding of the good,”<a href="#_ftn11">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn11"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then the goodness that we seek will only be fully realized at the end. Perfection cannot be experienced in history but will be a result thereof. If today we suffer evil, his argument goes, that is because the arrival of the good has been delayed. Creation is still groaning with labor pains, still striving toward its ultimate completion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This eschatologically oriented understanding of history, which proposes a “cosmological conversion” that accounts for “the ways in which the good appears as ‘a result of’ time”<a href="#_ftn12">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> situates man’s existence at an in-between. We are no longer at the beginning, not yet at the end. We are lacking, longing, desiring, moving, changing, struggling, striving; and the good is still unfolding around us by means of the movement of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what Manoussakis calls the “scandal of the good”—the fact that, when we experience the good, we experience it not as something good but precisely as that which is not good, that which wounds, the trauma of existence. “In a world and for a self that are not perfect . . . shouldn’t the good be perceived and experienced necessarily as evil?”<a href="#_ftn13">[</a></span><a href="#_ftn13"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yet if in the present moment we experience goodness as something evil, it is the passage of time, Manoussakis asserts, that can provide us with the necessary distance from the rupture to see it for what it is. Here, Manoussakis attempts to affirm the goodness of time by positing it as the tool of the good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That time heals all wounds is a truism. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethics of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, John Manoussakis reformulates this platitude and reminds us, perhaps, of a forgotten truth: time makes all things new.</span></p>

Weiss, Dov.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017.  ISBN 9780812293050. Hardcover, ebook. ix+291 pages.</strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pious Irreverence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opens with a quote from America’s favorite fictional president, Josiah Bartlet of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West Wing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After the funeral of his friend and personal secretary, Dolores Landingham, Bartlet asks for some time alone in the church where he prays, “What did I ever do to yours [your son] except praise his glory and praise his name?&#8230;Have I displeased you, you feckless thug?” I knew no Latin when I saw this episode, and so couldn’t understand what Bartlet yelled at God immediately after this, but I understood the force of his final words: “cruciatus in crucem, eas in crucem.” Screw you, God, Bartlet said; but wasn’t he also talking to God “as a man speaks with his friend” (Ex 33:11)? Wasn’t he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in church</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, having a conversation with the deity with whom he was so angry? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weiss notes that this scene was dubbed by one analyst as “the most Jewish scene ever written in English,” and his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pious Irreverence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is about the antecedents to this scene, the rabbinic and post-rabbinic moments that culminated in the God invoked by Aaron Sorkin, the creator of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West Wing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, through the character of President Bartlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These antecedents, Weiss shows, are most complex and developed in a lesser-known genre of Jewish literature, known as midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). These works, cast as homilies on various books and pericopae in the Pentateuch, perhaps created for a synagogue audience, are very popular in the manuscript record: there are 20 such works in hundreds of manuscripts. Other editions and works are preserved in quotation (Bregman 2007). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc Bregman tentatively dates the final redaction of these works to “post-Talmudic times,” in the Byzantine empire. This would place them anywhere from the sixth to the tenth century. Scholars in the 11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century like the biblical exegete Rashi already quote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the last </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-like works were redacted in Provence, by one “Moses the Preacher” not much before that. Thus, we can safely dub </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “post-rabbinic,” in the sense that the central shifts the rabbinic movement brought into the Jewish community were already accepted completely by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The shapers of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were adherents of rabbinic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but not part of the historical </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rabbinic movement</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-2224 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Midrash_Tehillim_30-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="415" height="282" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Midrash_Tehillim_30-300x204.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Midrash_Tehillim_30-768x523.jpg 768w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Midrash_Tehillim_30-1024x698.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" />TY </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">works evince a knowledge of rabbinic traditions but are not genetically related to that rabbinic behemoth, the Babylonian Talmud; in chapter two Weiss discusses points of affinity between the two corpora. Although pieces of Talmud and even a later work derived from the Talmud known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’iltot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are embedded in the manuscript tradition, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works are not of the same milieu as the Babylonian Talmud. Instead, they are a remnant from the community of Palestinian Rabbinic Jews, which had different priorities, another rabbinic school, different liturgy, and different laws. They also do not reflect Muslim rule in any way; for example, there are no Arabic loanwords. Thus, the Byzantine provenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These works have often been called “late midrash,” and neglected as a lesser exemplar of what those in the field like to call “classical midrash” (redacted 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> centuries in Byzantine Palestine). While the manuscript record has so many of these works, there is as yet not one critical edition of a Tanhuma-Yelammedenu midrash. In recent years, however, there has been an uptick in the slight interest these works have commanded in rabbinic scholarship: some studies of the relationship between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Jewish liturgical poetry (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">piyyut</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) (אליצור 1992), an article on the Hebrew language of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(וורמסר תשע&#8221;ג). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weiss is the first in over 20 years to attempt a thematic study of the entire </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">corpus. Unlike his predecessors, trained in philology and literary theory, Weiss is a scholar of religion. I use this word, in this case, in the old-school sense of “Theology.” Questions about the nature and character of the rabbinic God and His role in the lives of the rabbinic authors animate the book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rabbis and their lives have been the subject of scrutiny from many different angles in the past decades, since chairs dedicated to rabbinic Judaism have increasingly found their way to departments of religion. Veering away somewhat from subjects and themes defined by the texts or having the texts be the subject of inquiry, many scholars of rabbinics have focused on rabbinic special perception, senses and sensuality, sex and corporeality, and law and legalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is only a smattering of the explosion of monographs and articles dedicated to the rabbis since 1990. None of these, however, have been about the rabbinic God. Some have advanced the idea that the rabbis in fact had no God, or that their God was largely absent. The rabbinic project is either a theodicy of this absent God, or conversely a substitution of God with something else (gentiles have been offered as a replacement, as has been the law itself) (Hayes 2015; Rosen-Zvi and Ophir 2018).</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pious Irreverence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stands out in its charting out a colorful and complex dialog between rabbis and God in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The six chapters of Weiss’ book respond to various aspects of the Talmudic and post-Talmudic tradition of divine confrontation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is divided into two unequal parts. In the first two chapters Weiss offers readers a discussion of the normative aspects of divine confrontation. In early rabbinic literature, known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tannaitic Literature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, created in the late second and early third centuries CE in Palestine, confronting and questioning God is a sin. Tannaitic works of midrash preserve a prohibition against second-guessing God (הרהור) and confronting Him (השבה). These are, Weiss claims, “a new moment in the history of Jewish theology.” Weiss offers some historical contextualization for this moment, both in the history or myth of Tannaitic martyrdom as well as polemic with movements such as Marcionism and “Gnosticism”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weiss also offers an illuminating and cross-cultural discussion of the conceptual underpinnings of this prohibition. The Tannaitic prohibition against questioning and confronting the divine continues into post-rabbinic literature — at least in some texts. In these texts, confronting the divine sometimes brings about punishment as well: the sage Levi is made lame (33); Abraham is compelled to sacrifice his son (36). The chapter ends with a survey of the various Jewish and Christian responses to divine confrontation in scripture, especially Job and Habakkuk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter two Weiss charts the rise of the biblical theology of divine confrontation in later rabbinic literature, known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amoraic Literature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in post-rabbinic literature. This theology  asserts that it is permissible and virtuous to confront God and his decisions. Some traditions that forbade questioning the divine were re-worked and made more ambivalent. Other Tannaitic traditions were explicitly reworked to permit challenge where one was forbidden. These re-workings are common in rabbinic literature; Weiss applies the tools of rabbinic source criticism to understand, in each case, how they worked. Different characters, such as the ministering angels, were also employed to voice critiques that the rabbis did not want to place in the mouths of people. (Jenny Labendz discusses this strategy in her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socratic Torah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2013)). </span></p>

Vienna c. 1859-1871)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of these traditions is twofold: first, in that they show the rabbis reflecting on divine confrontation themselves. Second, the very existence of such traditions demonstrates that confronting God and His Justice are permissible in the rabbinic world. Weiss ends the chapter by pointing to rabbinic traditions that valorize standing up to God, as well as God himself approving of this move (70). The first half of chapter three continues the normative discussion, pointing out sources that approve of certain types of confrontation but not others. Weiss uses the Greek term </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">parrhesia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “frank speech” as a heuristic tool to understand this phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second segment of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pious Irreverence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shifts from a normative and diachronic discussion of the phenomenon of divine confrontation to a synchronic and descriptive analysis. Thus, the end of chapter three moves to the modes in which the rabbis performed their theological protests. Chapter four is a discussion of the ethics that led the rabbis to challenge God: what did they think was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how did they know it, and how did they know God was doing it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrong</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Chapter five is a discussion of the theology of confrontation, which I will discuss shortly, and chapter six is about the role of God in these confrontations, and most forcefully, his capitulation in arguments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways these three and a half chapters seem to be the heart of the book. No longer committed to drawing lines in the sand and tracing the evolution of the motifs and interpretive strategies in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works, Weiss seems happiest when presenting midrashic traditions and illuminating them. There are many excerpts of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> midrashim translated and commented on, as well as other passages which he summarizes. Chapter four on the ethics of confrontation is a treasury of dubious scriptural heroes — the ones who make liberal readers blush and fundamentalist readers happy. The nuanced responses of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preachers to these narratives are important, oft neglected resources for understanding the roots and motivators of liberal Jewish thought to this day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapters five and six, on the God of these confrontations, are a return to the topic most neglected in the academic study of the rabbinic world, God. Known to the rabbis and subsequent generations of their followers by various epithets, it seems that rabbinic the aversion to naming God has manifested itself in the academic study of the rabbis as an aversion to the study of the same. Weiss artfully sweeps aside the theological preconceptions of previous generations of academics who preferred to imagine the rabbinic God as a philosophical construct a la Maimonides or, as Weiss helpfully points out, the Kabbalistic tradition. The God of these two rival theologies is actually quite similar in His silence and absence of personality [155]. Going back to narratives about God in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and reading them for what they are, Weiss teases out the personality and humanity of God in these works. The many aspects of God’s action in the world divulge a plethora of personality traits and characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That God </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a personality unconstrained by philosophical notions of his abilities stands in contrast to contemporary Christian theologies. The latter sought to integrate the God of the Hebrew and Greek scriptures with Platonic or Aristotelian ideas of the divine. The rabbis, who consciously ignored philosophy and its traditions, made room for a “morally fallible God” (160), constrained by the dictates of the Torah but not always managing to live up to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weiss also offers the reader asides which would be profitably used in teaching: comparative studies of Jewish and Christian interpretations of certain biblical characters and passages in chapters one and two, as well as comparative analyses of terms in chapters three and four. He is careful in his comparisons, pointing out his methodology at the beginning of each section, and is conscious and explicit about the limitations of each tool he employs. This too is laudable and important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weiss’s book charts out the work ahead for scholars of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and comparative Jewish theology, but there are two areas which he leaves for others. The first is the textual study of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — its myriad manuscript traditions, the relationship between the various works, the Greek loanwords etc. Sensitivity to thematic, ideological, and theological shifts is an important tool in this work, and one which practitioners of textual analysis often ignore. Weiss’s systematic and conceptual work is a boon to those of us who often drown in the mass of variants and textual peculiarities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is comparative exegesis and comparative work more generally. For example, Weiss notes parallels to Syriac literature in secondary literature, but only in passing (86). Though there are significant affinities between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">piyyut</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jewish liturgical poetry, he does not even mention them. As the rabbinic adage goes, “the task is not upon you to complete, but you are not free to avoid it.”  Others can follow in Weiss’s footsteps in these areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both in terms of its content and its methodology, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pious Irreverence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a pioneering work. Weiss artfully employs all the tools of textual analysis developed over the last four decades of rabbinic scholarship and brings them to bear on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a largely neglected corpus. Tanhuma-Yelammedenu has never been studied as a work of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">theology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nor from a theological perspective. The old-school search for God in this book has never seemed so new or so fresh, and neither has the rabbinic God Himself. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amit Gvaryahu holds a BA in Talmud and Classics from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and received his MA from the same institution in 2012. In 2010 he was scholar-in-residence at the Paideia Institute in Stockholm. He has also taught at the Hebrew University, the Pontifical Gregorian University, and Mechon Hadar in New York, as well as studied at Oxford and Princeton. His interests range from rabbinic literature to comparative ancient law, the ancient economy, midrash, and rabbinic textual criticism. His doctoral dissertation, on the rabbinic laws of usury in a comparative context, is slated for completion later this year. His latest article, &#8220;Twisting Words: Does Halakhah Really Circumvent Scripture&#8221; was published in the Journal of Jewish Studies. He lives in Jerusalem with his family.</span></i></p>

Cahn, Steven M. New York: Columbia University Press, 2017. ISBN: 9780231181617. Paperback. 93 pages.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is amazing that a book of less than 100 pages can be simultaneously so brief and so repetitive.  The average chapter length of this book is only six pages, in which enormous concepts such as the existence of God, the problem of evil, and faith are treated neither substantively nor charitably. The greatest virtue of this book is that it is short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the preface Cahn clearly states his objective: “I seek to provide an accessible and, I hope, provocative overview of the sort of challenges philosophy presents to any version of supernatural belief, while also exploring the possibility of religion within a naturalistic framework” (ix). He also identifies his intended audience &#8211; those who do not believe that any religion is capable of not violating “the methods and results of scientific inquiry”, and offers a brief list of his sources. However, Cahn’s oversimplified account of theistic belief undermines his explanation of the ways in which philosophy challenges such beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first six pages, Cahn attempts to explain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> debunk the cosmological, ontological, and teleological arguments for the existence of God. Any one of these arguments could easily be worth a chapter alone. Cahn chooses here, as he does several times throughout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religion Within Reason</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to opt for breadth as opposed to depth. He concludes the chapter by admitting that these arguments “might be rendered more plausible” (6) than he suggested, but in lieu of addressing them more fully or fairly he would rather ask a different question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In refusing to engage in a fair-minded way with the material he presents, Cahn sets up thousands of years of philosophical and theological arguments concerning the nature of the divine as straw men to be ripped to shreds on a moment&#8217;s notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first chapter relies on a problematic definition of God that Cahn invokes throughout the book. “Let us adopt the more usual view, common to many religious believers, that ‘God’ refers to an all-good, all-powerful, all-knowing, everlasting creator of the world” (1). This understanding of God is only “more usual”, as Cahn calls it, in an exclusively Western setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-2166 alignleft" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Consciousness-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="221" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Consciousness-300x200.jpg 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Consciousness.jpg 633w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" />In defining “God” in such terms he ignores all polytheistic religions, as well as any religions in which their deity is either morally imperfect, limited in power, finite in knowledge, or does not claim credit for the creation of the world. Satanism, Zoroastrianism, and Jainism, as examples, come immediately to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is more than acceptable to limit the scope of such a book project, Cahn says in his preface that he wants to discuss how philosophy challenges </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> version of supernatural belief.  That is impossible as he confines himself to predominantly Eurocentric subject matter. In chapter fifteen he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reference some non-Western religions, but only to make the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the astounding claim that when it comes to the religions of the world in their kaleidoscopic multiplicity, some have been &#8220;good&#8221; and some have been &#8220;bad&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter two Cahn explains the ways in which philosophical proofs for the existence of God have little to do with religion itself. Cahn takes four pages to say that since only a personal experience of the divine can be counted credible, proofs for the existence of God at best confirm what was already known and, at worst, are considered worthless in light of personal experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What initially seemed to be an interesting defense of religious exceptions to the assertions of philosophical reason turn out to be instead a mere rehashing of the relativity of belief. The relativity of religious contentions is a theme on which Cahn harps throughout the next four chapters. Chapters three to six all essentially echo the same sentiment which can easily be summed up in one sentence: “Hypotheses/Philosophies/Theologies which can neither be proven nor disproven are bad”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter three Cahn discusses the problem of evil.  The problem of evil derives from the question of how an omnipotent, omnipresent God can exist when evil also exists. Cahn whips up several solutions to the problem, then summarily dismisses them, before landing on John Hick’s solution, which distinguishes between moral and physical evil.  Moral evil, according to Cahn, is the result of free will, but physical evil offers human beings the blessed opportunity to improve their pitiful moral standing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter four Cahn turns Hick’s negative theology on its head, setting forth what he calls the &#8220;problem of goodness&#8221;. If one can justify an all-good, all-powerful God in a world crawling with evil, an all-evil, all-powerful demon in a world that contains good is just as plausible a hypothesis. What was perhaps intended as clever argumentation reads as snark, and John Hick’s theology is unnecessary to make this point. </span></p>
<p><img class=" alignright" src="http://www.creatingpeoplepower.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/disappointment-statue.jpg" width="556" height="369" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cahn’s fifth chapter entitled &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Moriarty Hypothesis</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a fanciful reimagining of the “problem of goodness” (which, again, is simply the inverse of the problem of evil), wherein the demon empowers Moriarity, the fictional villain from the Sherlock Holmes novels, to be the world’s greatest evil. This chapter oddly insists that theists by nature are always prone to judge harshly those who harbor doubts in the midst of their faith, and that “the more tenaciously we cling to belief, the less important is its content” (21).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear that Cahn conflates all theists with evangelical Christians of the garden variety. Perhaps he has not heard of Paul Tillich or N.T. Wright. Regardless, while evangelicals often do indeed attack those who doubt as Cahn describes, other theistic systems (think <em>bhakti</em> Hinduism), especially those in which there is a pantheon of gods from which to choose, are perfectly able to tolerate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uncertainty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter six Cahn offers another iteration of his criticism of the problem of evil, which he calls the “dummy hypothesis”. Cahn posits a world in which the hypothetical God and demon are equals in the struggle for power. When something good happens,  God has won. When something bad happens, the demon has gotten the upper hand. The problem with the dummy hypothesis, and the Moriarty hypothesis, and the problem of goodness, and the problem of evil, Cahn explains, is that they are all relative. Hypotheses need to be demonstrably true or false, or they all become “dummy hypotheses”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapters three through six serve as an overture to chapter seven, where Cahn grinds his axe at the apex of his argument. Seemingly ignorant of thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher and Francis Schaefer, who advocate for the role of rationality in religious faith, Cahn says, “To have faith is to put aside any doubts…” (26).  He differentiates between wise and foolish faith, but treats all faith as a security blanket for the uncritical mind eventually concluding that “faith of any sort opens the doors to intolerance” (29).  Yea, of course, like Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King, Saint Francis&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, in chapter eight Cahn turns to the Book of Job. Cahn reads Job as a critique of uncritical theology. In fact, he proposes that from Job “the more we know of God’s intentions the less they justify God’s actions” (30) and that “the book of Job does not justify God’s ways; rather, it doubts God’s goodness” (35). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cahn’s chief argument in this chapter is that doubting God is the entire purpose of Job, and later thinkers attempted to twist the tale into something more pious and palatable. If what Cahn says is true, however, it directly conflicts with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religion Within Reason</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s attempt to undermine theism. If the book of Job originally intended to encourage a critical examination of God, it would indeed align with reason without abandoning a theistic position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter nine, or &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Theodicy Trap&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, deals yet again with a concern for the relativity of religion, suggesting a successful theodicy needs to explain how God can be all good and all powerful when bad things happen to people who don’t deserve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter ten, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Problem of Meaning&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, deals with issues surrounding the claim that one “knows the will of God” or “knows God”. This chapter asks how we can know an incomprehensible God, but that&#8217;s about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" alignleft" src="https://44590e91f93137214d34-d73868e25b2d2bf91c2b7fd7417bb2e3.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/columbiauniversitypress_us_frontbookcovers_350W/9780231181617.jpg" width="257" height="397" />Chapter eleven discusses miracles, which Cahn defines as “an act of God that suspends the laws of nature” (45).  The example he uses is that if a bridge collapses and one guy is thrown clear and unharmed, it is a miracle… except for those who died. The four pages of this chapter essentially boil down to “theists believe in miracles; but if God does good things, who is responsible for bad things?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This point, while fair, harkens back yet again to chapters three through six and nine and ten. Religion/faith/the miraculous etc. (as framed by an understanding God in a Western context as applicable to any religion) has a supernatural element that is suspect for rational observers. Chapters three to six and nine to eleven add up to 28 pages, just shy of a third of the book. Had these chapters been condensed, perhaps Cahn could have found room to “render more plausible” the arguments he thought he was deconstructing; or perhaps the book could have been made into a pamphlet instead and saved a tree or two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter twelve gives us a two-and-a-half page stick figure drawing  of deism.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter thirteen informs us what the majority of Western philosophy has known for hundreds of years, namely, that Pascal’s wager doesn’t work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter fourteen puzzles all about why in the world people worship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cahn defines worship as “more than to revere, for in worshipping we depreciate ourselves and exalt another beyond challenge” (58). Where this formulation comes from is unclear. This view of worship meshes with his understanding of faith as inherently uncritical. Yet, he turns to Abraham as an example of what interaction with God should look like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cahn uses the example of Abraham bargaining with God to save Sodom from a fire-and-brimstone destruction.  God, as we recall, wishes to destroy Sodom for its wickedness, and Abraham begs God not to. Abraham asks that God reconsider. In doing do, Cahn believes that Abraham is not being &#8220;worshipful&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the faith of Abraham is revered in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam alike. Abraham is, in fact, the individual who institutes the tithe, considered an important act of worship in all three Abrahamic faiths. The Tanakh contains many stories of people questioning and testing God, and in a good number of those instances those who do so (such as Gideon and Jacob) are rewarded. The object of worship is not beyond questioning in any of these examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter fifteen contrasts Christianity and Jainism in an attempt to prove that religions are neither good nor evil as they have, in fact, been both at various points throughout history. This is the only place in which non-Abrahamic theism is addressed at any length, and the conclusion of religion’s moral neutrality does nothing to debunk theism of any ilk. That good people will use religion for good and evil people will use it for evil is not particularly revelatory or earth-shattering for anyone other than Cahn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter sixteen he finally offers his decisive solution to his contrived quarrel with theism. His answer?  Religion without God, of course. Cahn suggests that atheists and agnostics can be religious by participating in ritual, prayer, metaphysical belief, and moral commitment. This is the “religion within reason” after which the book is titled. Where Cahn (mis)defines terminology such as “God”, “faith”, and “worship” throughout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religion Within Reason</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he never defines religion itself. This is as close as he gets to expounding on his understanding of religion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter seventeen is an odd foray into heaven and hell. Cahn suggests divine justice as one of the major appeals of theism, citing the benefit of heaven as compensation for a life well lived, then goes on to tear down this profile.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cahn suggest that heaven will lack certain amenities we might be counting on i.e. no baseball for professional baseball players, having to spend eternity with people you hated while alive.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps as a &#8220;non-believer,&#8221; Cahn was briefed on what heaven is really like during a long conversation one evening over jello shots with Morgan Freeman. He asks questions about what our bodies would look like, what souls are, etc. and again cops out of seeking a genuine answer to them by concluding that “speculating about such obscure matters does not provide a reliable foundation for theism” (80), which no one aside from Cahn ever claimed that it did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter eighteen assures the agnostic and/or atheist that a life without God still has meaning and in no way precludes them being kind and loving… which doesn’t need said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pages of the book are solely dedicated to quoting I. L. Peretz’s tale </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Not Higher </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in full. Cahn<img class=" wp-image-2165 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dp-300x298.png" alt="" width="355" height="353" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dp-300x298.png 300w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dp-150x150.png 150w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dp.png 465w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" /> concludes with a tale of a man who becomes a disciple of a rabbi because of the moral way in which he lives, not the theologies he espouses, in an attempt to convince his readers that to do so is desirable. Consistently, the most interesting statements in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religion Within Reason</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the places in which Cahn quotes other people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest drawback to <em>Religion Within Reason</em> is that it answers questions no one is asking. The suggestion that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> atheists can be religious without being theistic is not, in any sense, new. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It adds little of value to current academic discourse in the philosophy of religion, and serves not even as an elementary sort of primer on the theological and philosophical concepts it routinely references.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as we&#8217;ve emphasized, you can certainly get through it before you might possibly decide it&#8217;s really not worth reading.</span></p>

Hardcover, Paperback. 352 pages.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If for nothing else, 2017 was a good year (at least for the English-speaking world) because we have received a variety of new works of philosophy from Giorgio Agamben. During the last year we have been given, for the first time, translations of his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fire and the Tale</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mystery of Evil</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Philosophy?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taste;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, the nine volumes of the now-complete </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homo Sacer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">project were published together as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Omnibus Homo Sacer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making the series more readily available than before. Moreover, we also received what is perhaps the most significant contribution to the literature surrounding Agamben’s work in recent years: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, edited by Adam Kotsko and Carlo Salzani. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book brings together 30 essays, each on one of the major thinkers that has shaped Agamben’s thinking. This collection is particularly helpful for both those new to and also for those already well versed in Agamben’s work. Grasping the force of his thought involves keeping track of not just of what he is saying, but also of his sources of inspiration and the way he transforms their original ideas. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serves as a welcome guide to readers hoping to better navigate Agamben’s disorienting and ever-growing corpus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A defining mark of Agamben’s work is subtly. His interpretation and application of the work of others is often indirect. Motivating Agamben’s love for philosophy is, in his words, the challenge of locating ideas in the work of others “that have remained—or have willingly been left—unspoken and that need to be found and seized” and elaborated upon.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On what seems like every page he writes, Agamben gathers thoughts from thinkers of the past in order to reveal their persistent contemporaneity, their ability to problematize our sense of the present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, a major goal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of uncovering, “rendering explicit what remains implicit” in Agamben’s engagement with other thinkers (1). Kotsko and Salzani’s aim to present Agamben in a way that matches the spirit of Agamben’s own philosophy. Especially helpful in this regard is the way Kotsko and Salzani are not content to introduce the volume (in their chapter, “Agamben as a Reader”) by merely spelling out the logic and structure of the book. Instead, their introduction serves as an essay in and of itself, explaining how Agamben’s method of reading, studying, and citing tradition exceeds the realm of methodology and bleeds into the realm of philosophy proper. In doing so, they situate the most prominent of Agamben’s philosophical developments—e.g., potentiality, the messianic, deactivation, and abandonment—within his practice as a reader, and not just as a writer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presents itself as a mere collection of essays, serving to provide readers various points of entry into the work of Agamben. If one has an interest in Kant: read the chapter on Kant; if one needs quick insight into his use of Carl Schmitt—turn there. Indeed, the book is divided into three easily navigable sections, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organized around the multitude of Agamben’s interlocutors. In descending order of relevance—from “Primary Interlocutors” to “Points of Reference” to “Submerged Dialogues”—the volume first discusses the thinkers Agamben most directly engages (such as Aristotle and Benjamin); it then turns to thinkers he often evokes but with whom he has a less sustained dialogue (e.g., Arendt, Deleuze, Hölderlin); and finally it covers thinkers he discusses only in passing, but ones who have given shape and color to the background upon which he writes (like Adorno, Scholem, and Weil). So, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n many ways, the collection appears to most closely resemble a reference work, perhaps akin to something like a philosophical dictionary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a virtue of Ali Efal-Lautenschläger’s chapter on Aby Warburg is its clarificatory aim. Warburg’s thought is no doubt less familiar to most readers than many of the figures discussed in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, for those who do know something of Warburg’s thought, the emphasis is usually placed on the art-historical significance of his work on “the image” and visual art. As Efal-Lautenschläger explains, however, Agamben’s interest in Warburg is less related to imagery and art, and has more to do with the concept of time. Her chapter, therefore, focuses on detailing the way “Agamben’s reading of Warburg differs substantially from those of major art historians influenced by Warburg” (208). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-1815 alignright" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/9781474423649-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="377" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/9781474423649-200x300.jpg 200w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/9781474423649.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" />She describes the way Agamben understands signatures and gestures as dynamic “carriers of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mediality</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” rather than notions relating to something’s static appearance or image (213). She also singles out, in a reference-like way, the ideas that sit at the nexus between Agamben and Warburg, referencing relevant passages where Warburg is discussed. Several chapters in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(such as “Guy Debord,” “Plato,” and “Friedrich Nietzsche”) share a similar aim and architecture. Many chapters are structurally reminiscent of expanded dictionary entries: their primary aim being to provide readers insight into the details that are most immediately relevant to understanding Agamben’s engagement with a thinker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, although many of the chapters indicate that the function of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that of a dictionary-like reference collection, other chapters take a different approach. At times, the task of the volume feels more creatively ambitious. Take, for example, the chapters on Simone Weil and Theodor W. Adorno, written (respectively) by Beatrice Marovich and Colby Dickinson. Doing more than laying out a scene, Marovich and Dickinson argue for and against ways of understanding Agamben’s reading of Weil and Adorno, thereby positively expanding the dialogue surrounding his relation to both figures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Marovich’s chapter, she considers the extent to which Weil’s notion of creaturely life serves as an “unmarked influence” on Agamben’s idea of bare life (296). She begins by surveying, and finding wanting, the recent accounts of both Leland de la Durantaye and Alessia Ricciardi. On her account (which she admits is speculative), Weil has been under-recognized on the issue. She therefore makes the case that Weil “could be cited more frequently in genealogies of Agamben’s bare life” (293). Similarly, for his part, Dickinson uses his essay to demonstrate that, despite the supposed conceptual distance between Agamben and Adorno, the two thinkers share much at the level of method. To do so, he highlights the fundamental role that Agamben gives to the “unthought” elements in the history of philosophy; and he then draws connections between Agamben’s search for the philosophically “unthought” and Adorno’s quest for an account of the non-identity at the heart of philosophy. By the end, Dickinson effectively shows “how the alleged differences [between Agamben and Adorno] might be exaggerated to some extent” (220). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are benefits and limitations to both aspects of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As anyone who has read Agamben will know, his work is both dense and elusive. Making matters worse, the work of the figures he elaborates upon is no less intimidating. Thus, the fact that many chapters read like straightforward works of reference offer a much-needed relief to those who familiar with some element of Agamben’s work, but know nothing of thinkers like Marquis de Sade. With Christian Grünnagel’s help, readers are given not only a clear presentation of Agamben’s fascination with Sade, but are also given further insight into Agamben’s more general tactic as a reader. As Grünnagel’s study concludes: Agamben “prefer[s] an open dialogue with [the thinkers he engages], underlining more the strength of their thought rather than pointing out flaws or problematic passages in their works” (198). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some chapters function like dictionary entries, others transcend the level of mere presentation and their multivalence takes readers deeper into the literature surrounding Agamben’s thought. To the initiate, however, these chapters—because they cover more ground in such little space (each essay in the volume is only around 10 pages in length)—such chapters may render Agamben’s work no less impenetrable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to compile a volume such as this, Kotsko and Salzani have, by necessity, had to individuate chapters according to single thinkers. And, while one may not feel compelled to read the entirety of many edited volumes—choosing to read only the essays specific to one’s topic of interest—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewards the thorough reader. An important detail to remember in this regard is that, within his own work, Agamben is always found not just sourcing and appropriating the work of others; rather, he consistently mediates his ideas between many thinkers at once. The volume bears witness to this feature of Agamben’s work when it is read as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chapters on Franz Kafka, Immanuel Kant, and Michel Foucault (written by Anke Snoek, Susan Brophy, and Vanessa Lemm) cohesively tie together Agamben’s criticism of the notion of sovereignty with his concern that, in the modern age, the law is “in force without significance.” As Brophy points out, for Agamben, Kant’s notion of the laws of reason are essentially empty abstractions, one’s that exert an ethical force only “‘as if’ there were a substantive connection to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">noumenon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, despite this connection being precluded from the outset” (166). Moreover, as Snoek makes clear, Agamben’s criticism that modern ethics are empty, yet still in force, comes from his reading of Kafka. What Kafka’s tale’s reveal to Agamben is that “if the does not prescribe anything, it is impossible to distinguish between the law and its violation” (156). In other words, when the law lacks specific content, what follows is not the dissolution of the law, but rather a law that exerts an even greater force: one that begins to blur the distinction between law and life itself. Already, between Kant and Kafka, Agamben’s theory of sovereignty (specifically, his claim that sovereignty leads to the production of bare life) begins to come into view. Hence, when the reader comes to Lemm’s chapter on Foucault, they are prepared to understand the significance that her claims have for Agamben. As she explains, “For Agamben, the rise of biopolitics does not reflect a shift from sovereign to disciplinary power as Foucault had thought. Rather the sovereign power of life and death stands at the logic inherent to biopolitics” already (53). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these examples demonstrate, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows readers to encounter what Antonio Negri infamously called the “two Agambens,” namely the “metaphysical” and “political” Agamben. Much of the attention surrounding Agamben has been generated by his provocative </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homo Sacer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">series. It is thus not surprising that so many of the essays focus on the politico-metaphysical elements of his thought (e.g., sovereignty, bare life, constituent power and destituent potential, temporality). However, as William Watkin has elsewhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convincingly argued, there is also “third Agamben”—the literary Agamben concerned with the voice, with poetry: language as the house of the non-linguistic, enjambment, the caesura, etc. While this Agamben is not wholly absent from the book, his presence is more like a trace, is much less perceptible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-1851 alignleft" src="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Agamben-portrait-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="506" srcset="https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Agamben-portrait-201x300.jpg 201w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Agamben-portrait-768x1147.jpg 768w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Agamben-portrait-686x1024.jpg 686w, https://jcrt.org/religioustheory/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Agamben-portrait.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" />The most notable exception to the conventional subtlety of the literary Agamben is Alysia Garrison’s chapter on Hegel. The strength of Garrison’s chapter is the way she embeds Agamben’s interest in the experience of speech—and in the way “language expresses the removal of the animal voice” (140)—within his notions of impotentiality and inoperativity. But again: given the importance of Agamben’s political project it comes as little surprise that the contributors to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have chosen to focus on the more explicitly political aspects (rather than on the aesthetic, literary, or poetic) of his thought. Of course, this is not to suggest that the literary aspects of Agamben’s work are wholly removed from his political interests (or vice-versa). Precisely the opposite: what I found myself wanting more of was an appreciation for the way his aesthetic-literary concerns cannot be disimbricated from his politico-metaphysical thought. The way, for instance, Agamben’s reflections on poetry—on enjambment and caesura—directly inform his understanding of messianic time. “If poetry is defined precisely by the possibility of enjambment, it follows that the last verse of a poem is not a verse. Does this mean,” Agamben wonders, “that the last verse trespasses into prose?” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">EP</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 112). The implication of this question exceeds literary form, touching also upon the zone of indefinability between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">chronos</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">eschaton</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cf., his reflections on caesura </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TR</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 64).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">contains a very complex portrait of Agamben—one more delicate than initially appears. What stood out to me, on the whole, was the way Agamben works against his own culture via his study of his own culture. Academic and scholarly activity: it is all very well hierarchized…the roles, positions, and thoughts are precisely defined. What Kotsko and Salzani’s collection succeeds in showing is the way Agamben quietly maneuvers, dissociating himself from the world of values that surrounds us all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s work, that is, involves learning how to create a disjunction between oneself and one’s time </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by reading everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—by confronting everything with everything. As Kotsko and Salzani put it, Agamben’s “philosophical lineage is not merely a reservoir from which he draws, but it is rather a tradition turned against itself, a tradition that, being itself alienated and ‘intransmissible’, is further disavowed, betrayed, warped, ‘deactivated’ and put to a new ‘use’” (4). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">makes clear, Agamben is not afraid to confront the towering figures of Western thought, troubling their ideas with even the most minor aspects of cultural history. The success of this book is in the way it provides a map of Agamben’s attempt to render inoperative his own culture by the very dissonances that comprise it. Agamben’s importance and relationship with Western thinkers is best summed up in the words of Foucault in reference to Bachelard: “He reminds me of skilled chess players who manage to take the biggest pieces with the pawns.” As demonstrated in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben’s Philosophical Lineage, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agamben has been and will continue to be a complex and captivating voice in modern philosophical discourse.</span></p>

Hardcover, Paperback, E-book, ix + 406 pages.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony McElligott and Jeffrey Herf’s edited collection </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antisemitism Before and Since the Holocaust</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grew out of an idea born at the conference on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial held by the Holocaust Education Trust Ireland in November of 2010, and is the culmination of their subsequent years of work and research. Esteemed professor in Germanic twentieth century history, Anthony McElligott has worked extensively with scholars and experts in Holocaust studies. His co-editor, Jeffrey Herf, is an American Historian as well as a distinguished professor of modern Europe – specifically Germany. Their shared interest in Holocaust studies welcomed the collaboration on an edited anthology focusing on antisemitism (13).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This edited collection contains five specific areas of focus for which the various contributing authors have provided “historical and contemporary perspectives” (3). The collection opens and closes with sections by leading scholars in the fields of Holocaust and antisemitism. The middle three sections include chapters on the relations between Christianity and Islam, the historical and contemporary issues of antisemitism in the United States and European countries, the role of metaphor and discourse in Holocaust studies, and how the use of these dialogues contributes to contemporary antisemitism. In the introductory chapter McElliot and Herf express that this volume does not provide one unified argument but aims to “expose the plurality of positions within the academy and reflect the robust discussions that took place during the conference” (4). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overarching thesis that the editors set forth as the claim, can be found on page three. The editors state: &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This volume not only broaches the issue of Islamist Denial of the Holocaust in the Middle East but also attempts to understand the Western Paradox by looking at antisemitism before and since the holocaust in Europe and the USA(3).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this argument does not limit the collection, it certainly tracks the articles into specific facets of scholarship. It does not leave much room for ideological variation across the articles. Looking at each section, we can access the overarching goals and ideas, and use specific articles to better understand how to utilize this text as a critical piece of scholarship and teaching tool. This volume, as the authors note, “combines historical, philosophical [,] …political [,] and social science approaches in an effort to tackle the phenomenon of antisemitism and its relationship to Holocaust denial both in the past and in the present” (6). Thus, accessing each section’s strengths and weaknesses will allow for a more thorough and accurate representation of the collection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part One, entitled “Two Preliminary Observations,” includes two writings. The first, “A Few Observations on Holocaust Denial” by Deborah Lipstadt, and the second, “Antisemitism and Holocaust Inversion” by Robert Solomon Wistrich. Lipstadt’s article focuses on the connection between Holocaust denial and antisemitism, arguing that denial is itself just a manifestation of antisemitism (23). The paired chapter in this section, Wistrich’s article, uses the foundational work laid by Jankelevitch to argue that Holocaust denial has been fused with pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism in European countries (42). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These articles create a nice parallel to one another with the former focusing on Holocaust denial as a form or reactionary form of antisemitism, while the latter article integrates denial into various political agendas, specifically including “militant Muslims.” This dualism is a central theme to the text; the edited collection, throughout each section, leans into both theoretical and practical applications of antisemitism. This section creates a cohesive and concise use of this dualistic approach as many of the other sections, as will be demonstrated, tend to overlap and reiterate many of the same sentiments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McElligott’s and Herf’s Part II is entitled “Religion.” This section includes author Christian Wiese’s understanding of Christianity and antisemitism, Mark Weitzman’s Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial in Catholic Traditionalists, and Bassam Tibi’s transition from traditional Islamic judeophobia into modern Islamist antisemitism. Weise, the first scholar in the section, argues that “the awareness of the fateful consequence of the long tradition of Christian anti-Jewish hatred… belong to the fundamental elements of Christian theological self-reflection after World War II.” </span></p>
<p>His explorative approach to understanding the Christian contribution to anti-Jewish stereotypes, ideas, and actions—as well as the implications of those negative characterizations to Nazi antisemitism—works to reclaim or re-answer questions “related to the political dimensions of Christian theology regarding Jews and Judaism.” This section worked well in conjunction with Weitzman’s article, but again, this collection works as an interplay between a theoretical— in this case theological-theoretical— approach and politicized approach.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" alignright" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/wjc-org-website/development/userfiles/image/090210_iht.jpg" width="414" height="416" />In his chapter, &#8220;&#8216;Every Sane Thinker Must Be an Anti-Semite&#8217;: Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial in the Theology of Radical Catholic Traditionalists”, Mark Weitzman opens the chapter with a discussion of the 2009 decision by Pope Benedict to lift the &#8220;excommunication of four bishops associated with the breakaway Society of Saint Pius (SSPX)&#8221; (83). Immediately after, one of the bishops, Richard Williamson, was recorded on Swedish television as having questioned the Holocaust and citing that &#8220;the historical evidence is strongly against it&#8221; (84). This radical Catholic movement has persisted, as well as questions regarding their association with Holocaust denial. Weitzman suggests, in his thesis, that &#8220;a closer examination of [these groups] will demonstrate that Williamson was not an isolated aberration, that antisemitism is indeed a foundational aspect of the core beliefs of the radical movement&#8230; and [they] deserve our attention because of their continued influence to both the Catholic Church and the general public discourse&#8221; (84). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This thesis posits Weitzman to claim that this extremist Catholicism is but a reminder that Western traditions of religious adherence also contain radical religious roots &#8220;that have left their mark on the shaping of our modern world&#8221; (84). Wetizman finds, over the course of his chapter, that the Church&#8217;s &#8220;open door&#8221; policy towards re-acceptance of those members who use their theology to diminish the beliefs of others, will cause Jews and other religious groups to continue to question the Church&#8217;s commitment to those issues. The only solution is to make clear to the radical Catholic traditionalists that their antisemitic beliefs are &#8220;a sin against God and humanity&#8221; (103). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final section, Tibi’s transition from traditional Islamic judeophobia to modern islamist antisemitism, worked seamlessly with Wiese’s piece, but felt disconnected from the Catholic Traditionalist perspective. While each article posited new information, this section leaned farther into a Christian/Catholic theological ideology than the section’s title “Religion” would assume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part III, while the longest of the five sections, proved to be the strongest, and most cohesive. “Historical and Contemporary Political Arenas,” has five chapters that compose this roughly-100-page section. This section works particularly well because although it does not create the explicit dualism mentioned previously, it does provide a general overview of several historical and contemporary examples of anti-Semitic ideology, politicization, and agendas. This chapter, from a geographic level, includes the United States, “the Arab World,” Iran, Germany, and Britain. This vast geographic span, as well as poignantly picked time-periods, creates a well-versed and well-informed historical additive to the collection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opening chapter on the United States, authored by Pierre Birnbaum, argued that there exists a third example of political antisemitism that is often overlooked by historians. He suggests that “the antisemitism of the French Third Republic and the unbound extremism of the Third Reich are the two poles between which historians usually broach this subject… [but] I wish to outline a third example… the United States” (151). Birnbaum looks to compare the link between the “state Jews” under the New Deal and political antisemitism in North America. The political antisemitism in the United States remained quite subdued compared to the French and German political climate of the time. However, understanding this third avenue of comparison reveals a vaster anti-Semitic climate during the years leading up to World War II than just of European nations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter eight, written by Jeffrey Herf, is titled: “Nazi Propaganda to the Arab World During World War II and the Holocaust: and Its Aftereffects” (183). Herf’s chapter opened with a definition of Islamism relative to the Nazi regime. He argues that </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Islamism, a hybrid of European and Islamist ideology, began in the Middle East in the 1920s, found refuge in Nazi Berlin during World War II, persisted in the postwar decades, shaped parts of Palestinian nationalism, and… has inspired terrorism of Islamist jihadism in Al Qaeda” (183). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opening argument positions Herf to create a historical dialogue about the relationship between the Arab world and the Nazi regime. He details specific moments that fall on this timeline, including the role of Arab exiles in Berlin during the WWII decades, the hybridity and mixing that resulted from fascist and Nazi ideologies, the role of broadcasting in the Arab world, and the Nazi’s willingness to find allies in the Arab world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Herf’s chapter, Litvak’s writing on Iranian Antisemitism argues that “Iranian discourse is thoroughly anti-Semitic in seeking to demonize the Jews as a whole, not just Zionists, often conflating both” (205). This chapter was a well-rounded historical overview of Iranian anti-Semitic ideology—its origins, historical precedents, and relation to the Holocaust, especially Holocaust denial. Litvak claims that the targets of Iranian antisemitism today are the Jewish people as a group “as well as Jewish culture and history, and in particular the political manifestation of Judaism that is Zionism” (207). A strong additive to this chapter was the author’s inclusion of the definitions (and distinctions) between anti-Judaism, antisemitism, and Zionism. These well-defined political moves helped to shape the trajectory of the chapter as well as speak to the issue of Holocaust denial and the factors that contributed to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litvak rounds his chapter out in one of the strongest conclusory sections of the anthology. Holocaust denial, in an Iranian context, is a clear manifestation of antisemitism and the Iranian discourse, he says, that “denies Jewish history and deprives the Jews of their human dignity by presenting their worst tragedy as a hoax” (221). Although this chapter was evidently based on Iranian contexts, the conclusion of the chapter spoke to the themes of the book and created cohesive ties to the other authored sections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following two chapters in the section worked with Germanic and British political agendas. These two chapters, authored by Werner Bergmann and Tony Kushner, respectively, operated outside of the expected historiography. While Germanic history is riddled with anti-Judaic and anti-Semitic political agendas, Bergmann’s section on “Antisemitism in Contemporary Germany” offered a refreshing twist on a well-known history. His section used quantitative data to discuss the “trends that emerged in Germany since the German reunification in 1990” (231). Bergmann’s section detailed various anti-Semitic attitudes and the trends that have followed in the years after 1990—tracing yearly, bi-yearly, and/or decade-based attitudes towards Jews. Kushner’s chapter on “Antisemitism in Britain,” begins with the revolutionary work of James Parkes who famously stated:</span></p>
<p>[Hostility] to the Jews can only be called anti-Semitic when it is abnormal in the sense that there is no adequate explanation for the form or the severity of its manifestation in the actual contemporary conduct of the Jews against whom it is directed (254).</p>
<p>This chapter’s historical work on British antisemitism includes the resurgence of antisemitism and more recent controversies. Like Bergman, he uses statistical evidence (voting results) to discuss where antisemitism has played out in modern British politics.</p>
<p>The strength of Part III and the contributing authors was due to the differentiated material, the geographic span of the topics, as well as the introduction and dissemination of key terms. Parts IV and V, “Method and Discourse” and “Further Observations,” paired well with Part I. Each section has two articles, resulting in the paralleled dualism that appeared early in the text. Part IV’s two chapters include: “’Stealing the Holocaust from the Jews’?

width="347" height="299" />Webman’s chapter, she states, was titled after Edward Alexander’s article, “Stealing the Holocaust,” published in 1980 (279). The “stolen holocaust” refers to an inversion of “the roles of the victim and the predator” (279) Webman makes use of her training, offering to the reader that she is not a scholar of the Holocaust but of Arab representations of the Holocaust (281). Her chapter focuses on “the Arab… public discourse which has incorporated the Holocaust into its own indigenous political vocabulary either for the reconstruction of Palestinian national identity, juxtaposing it with the… Palestinian catastrophe, or for the demonization and delegitimization of Israel” (282). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Palestinian Catastrophe— the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nakba—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">becomes Webman’s starting point. Her discussion centers around the use of the Holocaust to discuss what happened to the Palestinians. She offers examples of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nakba </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">denial and the comparison of victim status among the Palestinians and the Jews. Re-using the terminology of the Holocaust or comparing Israel to “the Third Reich and Israel’s policies to Nazi crimes causing a ‘holocaust disaster,’ or defining Gaza as a concentration camp” exemplifies, she says, “intentional misuse of terms and metaphors” (297). These metaphors and analogies not only suggest a minimization of the Holocaust, but contribute to the act of denial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wetzel’s chapter on “Soft Denial,” concerns itself with “the various and different forms of trivialization of the Nazi genocide of Europe’s Jews during the Second World War” (305). Wetzel’s chapter, like Webman’s offers a differentiated idea of Holocaust denial. Rather than an overt denial, or lack of acceptance, the issue of denial comes into play in the way that the Nazi terminology is reused or trivialized. However, Wetzel offers an interesting claim stating that the trivialization of the Nazi genocide does not always intend to diminish the Holocaust but “rather with the intention of using the Holocaust to draw attention to political or social issues, such as abortion, mass animal transports, and so on, or… to serve as an advertising ploy” (305). Wetzel’s chapter offers a good explanation of the differences between “holocaust distortion,” “holocaust inversion,” and “holocaust equivalence” especially related to Israel and Palestine. Wetzel’s article would have done well to precede Webman’s due its terminological elaborations. Nevertheless, Wetzel’s chapter offers the reader a modernized and differentiated form of soft core denial by using the web as a medium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wetzel also chooses to counter Deborah Lipstadt’s term “soft core denial” and instead argues for the use of the term “Holocaust trivialization” because “it better captures the complexity of the wide spectrum of minimization strategies, including those forms that do not follow any historical political objectives” (308).. She argues that the use of the term Holocaust for campaigning purposes and drawing attention to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> causes is particularly harmful because it plays into the trivialization she mentions. As Wetzel says, “the World Wide Web [is] an easily accessible, anonymous communications and propaganda medium… not only used by radical Islamists to distribute such content but also by extremist right-wing networks” (324). Wetzel’s article would have been better titled using her term, “holocaust trivialization,” rather than Lipstadt’s term that she does not fully agree with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright" src="http://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/dfa1b211-bf86-4d3d-90bb-c6eec6cd4770/a867c350-b8ad-4896-b926-f0b71c0cb1f8.jpg" width="404" height="309" />The final section, “Part V: Two Further Observations,” mirrors Part I and presents articles written by scholars in the field(s) of Holocaust studies and antisemitism. The first of these final chapters, “Five Reflections on Holocaust Denial…,” by Elhanan Yakira, includes a well-informed overview of the spectrum of what is considered hardcore denial versus softcore denial, as well as what falls in between. One key theme that shows up in the final chapters of the compilation, including earlier sections, is the idea of a spectrum of denial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holocaust denial, according to Yakira, can be organized on two axes, scales, or criteria. One “axe” would be the intensity of the denial; the other is “the ideological and political agendas and ends which the denial anti-narrative… serves” (341). Holocaust denial does not occur without provocation, motivation, or origination—thus, the motivations of the denier should be considered. Yakira chooses to offer structural connections of holocaust denial rather than casual explanations to contextualize what is more fruitful and less hazardous to the study of the Holocaust denial spectrum (349). Holocaust denial inadvertently then reproduces the structural elements that appeared in historical antisemitism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final chapter of the text is “Ex Malo Bono: Does This Latin Proverb Apply to Holocaust Denial? The Cunning of Reason,” by Robert Jan van Pelt. Pelt’s chapter offers “six instances in which Holocaust denial has, indeed, led to… worthwhile outcomes—instances in which some general good has emerged from this particular evil” (355). These six instances, or case studies include: two advancements in understanding the history of the Holocaust that emerged from deniers—the case against Hitler and the case of the Auschwitz Crematoria; an argument for the importance of the German decision to not protect public denial by laws that guarantee freedom of opinion; the resulting testimonies of eyewitnesses and survivors in the public realm as a result of the “challenges posed by Holocaust denial;” the discussion of the Irving Trial in 2000 that led to a “conscientious historian;” and finally, the gentling of the historians’ condition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chapter, upon first read, seemed a peculiar way to end this text. However, upon delving into each of these “instances,” it presents an alternative, pseudo-accepting scholarly analysis of Holocaust denial. For example, Pelt indicates that “until the 1970s, Holocaust survivors generally did not speak in public” (375). Pelt emphasizes that many survivors credit Holocaust denial “as the catalyst to ‘come out’ from the protection of the private sphere” (375). Even further, Holocaust denial motivated survivors to speak about their experiences and with the beginning of broadcasted television and news sources more readily, they could transmit their narratives to the listeners, escaping the private sphere, while also telling their story in a way that was less challenging. Understanding Holocaust denial as a catalyst for change rather than a brand of antisemitism, re-defines how scholars and historians understand how this type ideological politicization works </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change—not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against it. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antisemitism Before and After the Holocaust</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a well-informed edited collection of chapters, articles, observations, and scholarly works by experts in these respective fields. However, the repetitiveness of many of the arguments does not bode well for this to be a teaching text in its entirety. The implementation of this text in a class on Holocaust Studies, antisemitism, Modern Judaic studies, etc., would seem redundant. Intra-sectionally, there is high variation, but the text seems to continue to stress the issues with contemporary or new antisemitism and the problem with Holocaust denial. As a volume on antisemitism, broadening the scope of this topic would have better fit the intended model of the collection. Gearing the volume towards Holocaust denial exclusively rather than encompassing both anti-Semitic ideology and the spectrum of denial limits its potential applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collection undertook a large task in trying to unravel different ideologies of hate including denial, antisemitism, anti-Judaism, judeophobia, and the relative spectrums that occur within each of these categories. It became broad very quickly.  However, as a cohesive collection, each chapter presented well thought out and thorough ideas, and used an appropriate balance of detail and conciseness. For a volume this long, and a range of authors such as this, the editors worked well to create a unified compilation.</span></p>

ISBN-10: 0823274616. Hardcover, Paperback, E-book.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title of Mehammed Amadeus Mack’s latest book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexagon: Muslims, France, and the Sexualization of National Culture </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a wordplay within a wordplay, referencing French slang for the country itself, ‘the hexagon’. This wordplay, and negotiation of identity of the French culture at large, is brought up repeatedly within the work. Mack focuses primarily on the perception of Muslims (specifically Arab and African Muslims) in contemporary French society and media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mack’s central argument lies within the paradox and negotiation that settles easily within the French world, where Muslims are simultaneously </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sexual, and thus risking the safety of a fragile French society, as well as not sexual in the right </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ways</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, holding onto conservative and decidedly ‘non-French’ values and customs from their heritage nations. The book expands from this central premise, drawing on a host of disciplines and theories to better illuminate the media landscape in relation to the Muslim person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mack’s early chapters focus first on the idea of gender within French society. Chapter One particularly focuses on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">banlieue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or what would be more understood in English as ‘the projects’ or government-provided housing. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">banlieue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is usually a space on the outskirts of major French cities, where low-income and immigrant citizens exist. Mack showcases the negotiation of social and conceptual identity for these two distinct spaces. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">banlieue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is seen as not innately a French space, possessed more by the Franco-Arab Muslims than by ‘true’ French citizens. Therefore, it is a masculine space, controlled by the roaming gangs of virile Muslim men (and occasionally women). Meanwhile, the traditional image of France and of French cities are feminine with most media landscapes portraying France as ‘the motherland’ and somehow an innately feminine space, ripe for defilement and subjugation by those that are somehow not French enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 2 is the complement to this exposure of conceptual gender and space, breaking down the immigrant family unit and exposing the stereotypes inherent within French media landscapes. The seemingly ever-present stereotypes of immigrant families is well in present in France, according to Mack. The fathers are absent, both physically and emotionally, meanwhile the mothers worship their sons and ignore their daughters, smothering yet controlling. These form the basis for Mack’s three great images: the violent adolescent, the veiled woman/girl, and the impotent man. This forms as the framework for the rest of the book, as examples and case studies of popular and well-regarded media productions that engage with these three archetypes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mack’s violent adolescent is the young Arab, African, or Muslim man. He dresses in baggy clothes, and is presented like a thug. The juvenile doesn’t travel alone, but in groups. They are antagonistic towards effeminacy whether it’s projected in man or woman, and are always willing to act on it to showcase their virility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The veiled woman, in contrast, is demur and unassuming. She is too in control of her own </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexuality and gender presentation, <img class=" alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.muslimstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1351355082_1.jpg?resize=600%2C400" width="368" height="245" />hobbled by the cultural stigma that prevents her from being a “real” French woman. She also is then seen as the honeypot, capable of seducing French morals and values away from the population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the impotent father is the result of growing up as an immigrant. The impotent father is unable to control his family in this new world, unwilling to engage in the sexual conversation of the culture, and is emasculated by his position in the French nation. These archetypes are stereotypes, and as Mack asserts, entirely incorrect, but are helpful for French media to categorize and police identities outside the constructed mainstream. These archetypes allow the French to judge and criticize complex issues such as immigrant sexuality, cultural attachment, and familial structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What strikes in these early chapters are the attention and detail Mack pays to the complex media narrative around Arabs, Africans, and the general Muslim population in France. Rather than seeking out specific percentages or grouping media narratives into specific groups, he focuses rather on the tropes that he sees as problematic and endemic within the production of French media. Importantly on a qualitative work of this level, Mack does not spend time trying to moralize or even judge the media tropes in French culture. To Mack, the problem is that the stereotypes portrayed are reductive and create unproductive dialogue amongst Franco-Muslims and non-Muslim French. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many French Muslims that are indeed socially conservative, they may veil, and often have a very different idea of sexuality and the public-private divide compared to many non-religious and Christian French citizens. This, essentially, is why Mack creates the archetypes he does for his future analysis. His three provided archetypes are the most common, and focus specifically on the Franco-Muslim relationship to sex and the public-private divide. Furthermore, it grants Mack the flexibility to simultaneously expand the reductive narratives while also allowing him to reveal the problems of simply switching the trope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mack sees these tropes in a similar light to how feminist literature speaks of the Madonna-Whore trope, where women are either bastions of virtue or seductive beings of man’s downfall. Mack wants to avoid a similar problem with his given trope-narratives and wants to create nuance, avoiding general claims about the lives of Franco-Muslims and instead complicate the simple ideas of cultural binaries for marginalized communities shown in media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last chapters of the book examine complex media studies for the various Muslim peoples that exist within France. Mack spends most of his time breaking down how popular media forms (TV, film, selective novels) either engage with or subvert the traditional tropes and stereotypes of Muslim-French men. For these men specifically, Mack draws heavily on post-colonial theory, queer theory, and media studies in order to better understand why these media forms engage as they do. Mack’s most compelling case study is about Franco-Arab actors within the French cinema. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" alignleft" src="http://www.brandedgirls.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/handsome-Omar-Borkan-500x500.jpg" width="293" height="293" />Many of the more well-known actors in this vein earn their careers by starring within arthouse cinema productions, and almost always are cast as an ethnic man with an ambiguous or separated sexuality. This role has become a trope within French cinema, known both as the <i>homo de service</i> (token gay) and the <i>arab de service </i>(token Arab). Service also has multiple meanings within French language, and these characters are also seen mostly as plot-points or “servants to the story.” They often times are there to fulfill the French idea of the hyper-virile, masculine Muslim man to expose the protagonist (usually male) to an exotic and complex view of sexuality, straight in daylight and gay in moonlight. These protagonists are also almost always hurt by their sexual partner, being left with broken hearts or bruised bodies when attempting to drag the other man into the light and “proper” French society.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this unpacking of stereotypes is one major strand within the book, the other strand that Mack accomplishes is a nuanced study of the reality of Franco-Muslim men and women within France, an area where most authors do not succeed. Instead of simply a media study or media review, Mack invests time and effort to weave these two competing strands against their will, forcing two various different narratives to be in contact and conversation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every stereotype or trope within French media is forced to encounter the lived reality of people in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">banlieue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an encounter that is stressful on both narratives as it reveals the positive and negative of each narrative. Mack does not shy away from the semi-closeted existence of queer Franco-Muslims yet does not shy away from the often impoverished and oppressed reality of these same peoples in return. Instead, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexagon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals the required interaction of these two narratives and how often times, one cannot exist without the other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many newer films in France subvert the trope of the homophobic Arab man or the submissive Arab woman, allowing for greater visibility to the competing narratives within the nation. Pop psychology of the immigrant condition has been pushed aside in favor of a more practical attempt at true post-colonial work in order to recognize and assimilate Franco-Muslims better and more efficiently. Mack addresses the problematic nature of these growths, which still push Muslims as an ethnic and sexual Other that can never be seen as truly and inherently French. This is specifically why Mack does not seek to defend or attack the lives of Franco-Muslim individuals and focuses on the media narratives. Mack would be the first to acknowledge that many Franco-Muslims suffer from internalized homophobia or limiting and overbearing families. He, however, also wants these lives and experienced to be better explored and understood in modern French media, without forcing the trope to simply be a subversion which rejects the character and their cultural heritage. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexagon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an ambitious work, seeking to understand a qualitative perspective that is tenuous at best to present. Despite this, Mehammed Amadeus Mack largely succeeds in his attempts to showcase both the popular narrative and the lived experiences and identities of French Muslims, no matter how contrary they often seem when lain next to one another. Even more so, Mack manages to walk a fine line of accurately revealing and discussing controversial issues such as homophobia, racism, and sexism in French society without placing the blame on any one group of individuals or social group. His focus on the media productions itself are what sets his book apart from others, as it reveals the inner biases we all possess in society, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and how it can affect cultural production and cultural mindsets as a result. While the work sometimes delves too far into the portrayal of specific films or roles as a spokesman for the entire media landscape, all-in-all </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexagon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a key intellectual exercise in how to understand Islam, Muslims, and its place within the French imagination as well as the growing ethnic coalition that is the French people.</span></p>
